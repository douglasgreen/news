## Bundestag Approves Stricter German Immigration Policy

Germany's Bundestag recently approved a controversial immigration plan led by Friedrich Merz, the leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). The motion, which is non-binding, calls for stricter immigration controls, including rejecting asylum seekers at the border and establishing permanent border controls. It passed narrowly with 348 votes in favor and 345 against, with 10 abstentions.

The approval of this motion has sparked significant controversy due to the support it received from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. This collaboration broke a longstanding convention in German politics, where established parties have traditionally avoided working with the AfD. Friedrich Merz expressed regret over the reliance on AfD support but emphasized the need for action on migration policy.

The motion has been criticized by various political parties. The Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the Greens condemned the CDU for breaking away from the political center by accepting AfD support. The Left Party also criticized the proposals as "unfeasible" and "inhumane". Despite the controversy, Merz has called for further talks with the SPD and Greens to achieve a majority for the bill in future votes.

## Supermassive Black Holes Found in Early Galaxies

Astronomers have discovered that supermassive black holes in early galaxies are unexpectedly large, sometimes 1,000 times more massive than anticipated. This finding challenges existing theories about the formation and growth of black holes and their host galaxies.

### Key Findings

- **Unexpected Mass**: In early galaxies, the mass of supermassive black holes can be comparable to or even exceed the combined mass of the stars in their host galaxies. This is a stark contrast to mature galaxies like the Milky Way, where the stellar mass is typically 1,000 times greater than the black hole mass.
- **Observational Advances**: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has enabled astronomers to observe these massive black holes in distant galaxies. Previously, studies were limited to bright quasars, but JWST allows for the observation of lower-mass black holes and their host galaxies.
- **Implications for Galaxy Evolution**: The presence of such massive black holes in early galaxies suggests that these black holes could significantly influence the evolution of their host galaxies. They can affect star formation by expelling gas and dust through powerful jets.
- **Theoretical Challenges**: The discovery of these massive black holes supports the "heavy seed" theory, which posits that black holes could have formed from the direct collapse of massive gas clouds, allowing them to grow rapidly in the early universe.
- **Future Research**: Understanding how these black holes and their host galaxies evolved together remains a significant question. Further studies using JWST and other observatories are expected to provide more insights into the early universe and the formation of supermassive black holes.

These findings highlight the complexity of galaxy formation and the role of black holes in shaping the universe. They also underscore the importance of advanced telescopes like JWST in uncovering the mysteries of the cosmos.

## Egypt and Jordan Reject Trump's Gaza Relocation Proposal

Egypt and Jordan, along with the Palestinian Authority, have firmly rejected U.S. President Donald Trump's proposal to resettle Palestinian refugees from the Gaza Strip into their countries. This proposal was seen as a potential solution to the displacement caused by the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas.

#### Key Points

- **Egypt's Position:** The Egyptian government, through its Foreign Ministry, emphasized its support for the Palestinian people's right to remain on their land. President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi highlighted the public opposition in Egypt to resettling Palestinians, citing potential destabilization and security risks. Egypt's stance is rooted in its commitment to a political solution that includes the creation of a Palestinian state.
- **Jordan's Position:** Jordan's Foreign Minister, Ayman Safadi, stated that the solution to the Palestinian issue lies within Palestinian territories, not in relocating them to Jordan. Jordan, already hosting over 2 million Palestinian refugees, fears further destabilization and remains committed to the two-state solution.
- **Regional Concerns:** Both countries fear that accepting Palestinian refugees could undermine the prospects of a Palestinian state and lead to greater regional instability. The proposal is seen as potentially expanding the conflict and complicating peace efforts.
- **International Reactions:** The proposal has also faced criticism from other international actors, including European countries, who emphasize the importance of resolving the Palestinian issue within its current geographical context.

Overall, Egypt and Jordan's rejection of the proposal underscores their commitment to a two-state solution and their concerns about regional stability and security. The proposal is viewed as incompatible with the long-term goal of establishing a Palestinian state.

## US Economy Experienced Solid Growth in 2024

The U.S. economy concluded 2024 on a strong note, with a 2.3% growth rate in the fourth quarter, contributing to a 2.8% growth for the entire year. This performance was primarily driven by robust consumer spending, which increased at a 4.2% pace, marking the fastest growth since early 2023. However, business investment saw a decline, particularly in equipment, following two strong quarters.

Inflationary pressures persisted towards the end of the year, with the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures index (PCE), rising at a 2.3% annual rate in the fourth quarter. Core PCE inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, also increased to 2.5%.

Despite these inflationary pressures, the Federal Reserve maintained its benchmark interest rate, having made three cuts since September. The Fed's cautious approach reflects stalled progress against inflation, which had previously decreased from mid-2022 highs.

The U.S. economy's underlying strength, excluding volatile items like exports and government spending, grew at a 3.2% annual rate in the fourth quarter. This indicates resilience despite disruptions such as a Boeing strike and hurricanes.

Overall, the U.S. economy's solid growth contrasts with stagnation in Europe, highlighting its relative robustness. However, future growth may face challenges due to potential policy changes, such as tax cuts and import tariffs proposed by President Trump, which could impact growth and prices.
