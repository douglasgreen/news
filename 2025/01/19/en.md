## Avian Influenza A Vaccination Being Developed

As concerns about avian influenza A (H5N1) grow in the U.S., mRNA vaccines are being highlighted for their potential to address these challenges. The H5N1 virus, a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus, primarily affects wild birds and poultry but has also been found in dairy cattle and humans in the U.S. since March 2024. Although human-to-human transmission has not been observed, the potential for such a development necessitates pandemic preparedness.

Key points include:

- **Rising Cases**: There have been 66 confirmed human cases of H5N1 in the U.S. in 2024, with the first human death recorded in January 2025. The virus has affected over 900 dairy herds across 16 states.
- **Pandemic Preparedness**: The CDC, along with other U.S. departments, is actively monitoring the situation and collaborating on surveillance and prevention strategies. The development of a vaccine candidate is a crucial part of these efforts.
- **mRNA Vaccine Potential**: mRNA vaccines are seen as particularly promising due to their rapid manufacturing capabilities compared to traditional vaccines. There are currently 12 vaccines in clinical development for pandemic influenza, with five utilizing mRNA technology.
- **Support and Development**: The U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) is supporting the development of these vaccines, including funding clinical trials for candidates like Arcturus Therapeutics' ARCT-2304.
- **Challenges and Opportunities**: While there are concerns about the uncertainty of the H5N1 virus, the development of mRNA vaccines offers a significant opportunity to mitigate future pandemics. These vaccines can be quickly adapted to match current viral strains, providing a versatile tool in pandemic preparedness.

Overall, mRNA vaccines represent a promising strategy to combat avian influenza A, with ongoing efforts to develop and test these vaccines in preparation for potential outbreaks.

## ELN Clashes with FARC Guerrillas in Colombia's Catatumbo Region

The Catatumbo region in Colombia has recently witnessed intense clashes between the National Liberation Army (ELN) and dissident factions of the former FARC guerrillas. This conflict has resulted in over 80 deaths, numerous injuries, and the displacement of thousands of people.

### Key Points

- **Humanitarian Crisis**: The violence has led to a severe humanitarian crisis, with thousands fleeing their homes. Many have sought refuge in temporary shelters set up in schools and coliseums, while others have crossed into Venezuela.
- **Government Response**: The Colombian government has deployed additional troops to the region to restore order and has suspended peace talks with the ELN. President Gustavo Petro's "Total Peace" policy, which aimed to negotiate with all armed groups, faces significant challenges due to the ongoing violence.
- **Impact on Civilians**: Civilians have been caught in the crossfire, with reports of kidnappings and forced displacements. The conflict has disrupted local commerce and education, with schools closed and businesses shuttered.
- **Background**: The ELN and FARC dissidents are fighting for control over the region, which is a major cocaine-producing area. The collapse of a previous truce has exacerbated tensions, leading to the current escalation in violence.

The situation in Catatumbo highlights the complexities of Colombia's ongoing struggle with armed groups and the challenges in achieving lasting peace. The government's efforts to negotiate with these groups have been hindered by persistent violence and territorial disputes.
