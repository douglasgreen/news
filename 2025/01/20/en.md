## Ancient Viral DNA May Aid Early Embryo Development

Recent research has uncovered that remnants of ancient viral DNA, known as transposable elements,
play a crucial role in early embryo development. These elements, which make up over half of our
genomes, were once considered non-functional "junk" DNA. However, a study led by researchers at
Helmholtz Munich and Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t has shown that these elements are reactivated
shortly after fertilization, contributing to the plasticity of embryonic cells.

### Key Findings

- **Reactivation of Viral DNA**: The study found that ancient viral DNA, previously thought to be
  extinct, is re-expressed in mammalian embryos. This reactivation occurs during the early stages of
  development, a period characterized by high cellular plasticity.
- **Species-Specific Expression**: The research involved creating a single-embryo atlas by comparing
  embryos from various mammalian species, including mice, cows, pigs, rabbits, and rhesus macaques.
  It was discovered that each species expresses distinct types of these viral elements, indicating a
  conserved mechanism across species.
- **Implications for Gene Manipulation**: The activation of transposable elements provides new
  opportunities for gene manipulation. By understanding the regulatory principles behind these
  elements, scientists can potentially influence cell fate and direct stem cell differentiation,
  which typically requires manipulating hundreds of genes simultaneously.
- **Future Research Directions**: The study sets the stage for further research into specific
  regulatory elements, with implications for health, disease, and cellular processes. Understanding
  how these elements are regulated could advance reproductive medicine and provide insights into
  genome regulation.

### Conclusion

This research highlights the significant role that ancient viral DNA plays in early embryonic
development. By reactivating these elements, embryos may harness their regulatory capabilities to
influence cell differentiation and development. This discovery not only challenges previous notions
of "junk" DNA but also opens new avenues for scientific exploration in developmental and
reproductive biology.

## BCI Enables Paralyzed Man to Control Drone

A brain-computer interface (BCI) has enabled a paralyzed man to control a virtual drone using his
thoughts. This technology involves implanting electrodes in the brain to capture neural signals,

  severe mobility impairments by enabling them to interact with their environment in new ways.

Overall, the development of BCIs represents a significant step forward in assistive technology,
providing hope for enhanced autonomy and communication for individuals with paralysis.

## Biden Preemptively Pardons Trump Critics

President Joe Biden issued historic preemptive pardons for several individuals, including former
NIAID Director Anthony Fauci, retired Gen. Mark Milley, and members of the House committee that
investigated the January 6 Capitol attack. These pardons were granted on Monday, just before
President-elect Donald Trump's return to the White House. The pardons provide broad immunity to
these individuals, who have been targets of Trump's threats to investigate or jail his political
enemies.

Biden's decision to issue these pardons is significant because it aims to protect these individuals
from potential politically motivated investigations and damage to their reputations or finances. In
his statement, Biden emphasized that the pardons should not be seen as an acknowledgment of any
wrongdoing by the recipients. Instead, he expressed gratitude for their service and sought to shield
them from baseless accusations.

The pardons cover individuals who have been vocal critics of Trump. Dr. Anthony Fauci, who led the
nation's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, faced repeated attacks from Trump. Gen. Mark Milley,
former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had warned about Trump's authoritarian tendencies.
Former Rep. Liz Cheney, a prominent member of the Jan. 6 committee, was also pardoned, as Trump had
previously suggested that committee members should face jail time.

In a surprising move, Biden also pardoned his siblings and their spouses. This decision was made in
response to what Biden described as "unrelenting attacks and threats" against his family, motivated
by partisan politics. The family members pardoned include his brothers James and Francis Biden, his
sister Valerie Biden Owens, and their respective spouses. Biden stated that these pardons should not
be interpreted as an admission of guilt or wrongdoing by his family members.

This unprecedented use of presidential clemency by Biden underscores the tense political climate and
the potential for retribution by the incoming administration. The pardons serve as a protective
measure for those who have been involved in holding Trump accountable for his actions related to the
January 6 insurrection and other matters. Biden's actions have drawn criticism from both sides of
the political spectrum, with some viewing the pardons as a necessary safeguard and others as an
overreach of presidential power.

  intelligence, urging for safeguards to ensure AI benefits society and does not threaten rights,
  privacy, or security.
- **Call for Reforms**: He advocated for reforms such as eliminating "dark money" in politics,
  banning stock trading by Congress members, and imposing term limits on Supreme Court justices. He
  also suggested amending the Constitution to ensure no president is immune from prosecution for
  crimes committed in office.
- **Encouragement to Stay Engaged**: Biden urged Americans to remain engaged in the democratic
  process, emphasizing the importance of a fair shot for everyone and the need to uphold democratic
  principles.
- **Transition of Power**: Without mentioning President-elect Donald Trump by name, Biden vowed a
  peaceful transition of power and expressed hope for the future, despite his concerns about the
  direction of the country.

Biden's address was both a reflection on his long political career and a call to action for the
American people to safeguard democracy and continue striving for a fair and just society.

## China Performs Record Fusion Experiment

China has set a new world record in nuclear fusion by maintaining a plasma temperature exceeding 100
million degrees Celsius for nearly 18 minutes. This achievement was accomplished at the Experimental
Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) facility, often referred to as the "artificial sun." The
temperature reached is seven times hotter than the sun's core, which is approximately 15 million
degrees Celsius.

This breakthrough is a significant step towards realizing nuclear fusion as a viable energy source,
which could provide unlimited, clean energy. The process involves fusing hydrogen and deuterium
gases, mimicking the sun's energy production method. The Chinese scientists aim to develop a fusion
reactor capable of continuous operation, which requires stable plasma temperatures hotter than the
sun.

The China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) plans to build the first industrial prototype fusion
reactor by 2035 and aims for large-scale commercial use by 2050. This development is part of a
broader international effort, including the ITER project in France, to harness fusion energy.
Despite the progress, challenges remain, such as developing materials that can withstand the extreme
conditions inside a fusion reactor.

## Dark Oxygen Discovered

Recent research has uncovered a surprising phenomenon on the ocean floor: the production of oxygen
by polymetallic nodules, which are mineral deposits found in the deep sea. This discovery, termed
"dark oxygen," challenges the traditional understanding that oxygen is primarily produced through
photosynthesis by plants and algae.

### Key Discoveries

- **Polymetallic Nodules**: These nodules, found in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ) of the Pacific
  Ocean, are rich in metals like cobalt, nickel, copper, and manganese. They are capable of
  generating oxygen through a process similar to electrolysis, where metal ions create electrical
  charges that split water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen.
- **Unexpected Oxygen Production**: The discovery was initially met with skepticism, as it
  contradicted the long-held belief that oxygen production requires sunlight. However, repeated
  experiments confirmed that oxygen levels increased in the presence of these nodules, even in
  complete darkness.
- **Implications for Extraterrestrial Life**: This finding opens up new possibilities for the
  existence of life on other planets. If oxygen can be produced without sunlight, similar processes
  might occur on other celestial bodies with oceans and metal-rich rocks, such as Jupiter's moon
  Europa or Saturn's moon Enceladus.

### Environmental and Scientific Implications

- **Deep-Sea Mining Concerns**: The discovery has significant implications for deep-sea mining, as
  these nodules are targeted for their valuable metals. Mining could disrupt the oxygen production
  process and harm the unique ecosystems that depend on it.
- **Astrobiology and Evolution**: The presence of dark oxygen suggests that aerobic life could have
  originated in environments previously thought inhospitable. This challenges existing theories
  about the evolution of life on Earth and potentially other planets.

### Conclusion

The discovery of dark oxygen on the ocean floor is a groundbreaking finding that not only reshapes
our understanding of oxygen production on Earth but also expands the possibilities for life beyond
our planet. It highlights the need for careful consideration of deep-sea mining practices and
encourages further exploration into the origins and evolution of life in extreme environments.

husband, President-elect Donald Trump, introduced his own cryptocurrency, $TRUMP. The launch took
place on the eve of Trump's inauguration as US president. Melania announced the launch on social
media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, stating, "The Official Melania Meme is live! You can
buy $MELANIA now".

The $MELANIA coin is a crypto asset tracked on the Solana blockchain. It quickly gained attention,
with its price rising significantly shortly after its release. The coin's market cap reached over $5
billion, and it was trading at over $10 by the evening of its launch day. However, the introduction
of $MELANIA had a dramatic impact on the $TRUMP coin, causing its value to drop by nearly 40% as
investors shifted their focus to Melania's new coin.

Both $TRUMP and $MELANIA are categorized as "meme coins," which are highly speculative
cryptocurrencies often created as jokes or parodies. These coins are known for their volatility and
lack of inherent utility, making them risky investments. Despite this, they have attracted
significant attention and investment, partly due to the high-profile figures associated with them.

The launch of these coins has sparked discussions about the potential for regulatory changes in the
cryptocurrency industry under the incoming Trump administration. Donald Trump has promised to be a
crypto-friendly president, suggesting a possible shift in the regulatory landscape that could
benefit the crypto sector.

## NHS Will Trial Brain Implant

The NHS is set to trial a new brain implant that uses ultrasound technology to improve mood in
patients. This innovative device, developed by the US-based non-profit Forest Neurotech, is designed
to be implanted beneath the skull but outside the brain. It works by mapping brain activity and
delivering targeted ultrasound pulses to activate specific clusters of neurons. The trial, funded by
the UK's Advanced Research and Invention Agency (Aria), aims to test the safety and tolerability of
the device on about 30 patients.

The technology holds promise for treating conditions such as depression, addiction, OCD, and
epilepsy by rebalancing disrupted brain activity patterns. Unlike invasive implants that require
electrodes to be inserted into the brain, this device uses ultrasound to read and modify brain
activity across multiple regions simultaneously. This approach could potentially benefit a wide
range of patients with "circuit level" conditions.

The trial will involve patients who have had part of their skull temporarily removed due to brain
injury, allowing the device to be tested without additional surgery. The device can detect changes
in blood flow to create detailed 3D maps of brain activity and deliver focused ultrasound to
stimulate neurons. The study will run for three and a half years, with the first eight months
dedicated to securing regulatory approval.

While the technology offers exciting possibilities, it also raises ethical concerns regarding data
privacy and the potential for neuro-discrimination. Researchers emphasize the importance of
addressing these issues and ensuring that interventions are in the best interests of patients.

## Nigerian Fuel Tanker Explodes

A tragic incident occurred in northwestern Nigeria where a fuel tanker explosion resulted in the
deaths of 86 people. The explosion took place at Dikko Junction in Niger State when residents
attempted to collect leaking fuel from an overturned tanker. This act of collecting fuel led to the
ignition and subsequent explosion, killing many at the scene, including rescuers.

The aftermath of the explosion was severe, with 55 people injured and receiving treatment in
hospitals around the Suleja area. The victims were mostly impoverished residents who were trying to
gather the spilled gasoline, a consequence of the significant increase in gasoline prices in Nigeria
following the removal of a fuel subsidy by President Bola Tinubu in May 2023.

In response to the tragedy, a mass burial was organized for the victims, with 80 bodies buried in a
mass grave at the Dikko Primary Healthcare Centre premises. Five bodies were claimed by their
families, and one person died at the healthcare center. The Niger State Government has implemented
new safety measures to prevent similar incidents in the future, including rerouting vehicles away
from the Dikko Bridge.

## Oxfam Reports Surge in Wealth

Oxfam's latest report highlights a significant surge in billionaire wealth, predicting the emergence
of the world's first trillionaires within the next decade. The report, released ahead of the World
Economic Forum in Davos, reveals that the wealth of the richest individuals grew by $2 trillion in
2024, three times faster than the previous year. This rapid accumulation of wealth is contributing
to a growing disparity, with the richest 1% now owning 45% of global wealth, while 44% of the
world's population lives on less than $6.85 per day.

Key figures expected to become trillionaires include Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Larry Ellison, Mark
Zuckerberg, and Bernard Arnault. The report also emphasizes that a significant portion of
billionaire wealth is inherited, with more billionaires in 2023 gaining their wealth through
inheritance rather than entrepreneurship for the first time. This trend is exacerbated by lax
inheritance tax policies in many countries.

Oxfam criticizes the increasing political influence of the wealthy, exemplified by the Trump
administration, which includes numerous billionaires. The report calls for urgent action to address
this inequality, including fair taxation of the rich and corporations, to prevent the concentration
of wealth and power that threatens democracy and economic fairness.

## Oyster Proteins Studied to Fight Drug-Resistant Bacteria

Recent research has highlighted the potential of oyster proteins, specifically antimicrobial
peptides (AMPs) from the Pacific oyster (_Crassostrea gigas_), in combating drug-resistant bacteria.
These proteins, known as Cg-Defs and Cg-Prps, have shown promising antimicrobial properties against
various bacterial strains, including those resistant to conventional antibiotics.

### Key Findings

- **Diversity and Potency**: The study found that different forms of oyster AMPs exhibit varying
  levels of antimicrobial potency. For instance, Cg-Defh2 is particularly effective against
  Gram-positive bacteria, with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values significantly lower
  than other forms like Cg-Defh1 and Cg-Defm.
- **Mechanisms of Action**: Oyster AMPs operate through diverse mechanisms. Cg-Defs inhibit
  peptidoglycan biosynthesis in Gram-positive bacteria by binding to cell wall precursors, while
  Cg-BPI targets Gram-negative bacteria by permeabilizing their membranes.
- **Synergistic Effects**: The study also noted that combining different oyster AMPs can produce
  synergistic effects, enhancing their antimicrobial spectrum and potency. This synergy could be
  crucial in developing new treatments against resistant bacterial strains.

### Implications

The findings suggest that oyster AMPs could be a valuable resource in developing new antimicrobial
therapies, especially as antibiotic resistance becomes a growing global health concern. By
leveraging the natural diversity and potency of these peptides, researchers may be able to create
effective treatments against a wide range of drug-resistant pathogens.

Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated Donald Trump on his election victory and expressed
his readiness to engage in dialogue with the United States. Putin made these remarks during a policy
forum in Sochi, Russia, highlighting Trump's campaign promises to improve U.S.-Russia relations and
address the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.

Putin praised Trump for his "courageous and manly" response to a previous assassination attempt and
acknowledged Trump's statements about ending the war in Ukraine. However, Putin emphasized that
Russia's demands, such as Ukraine abandoning NATO aspirations and withdrawing troops from regions
claimed by Russia, remain unchanged.

The Kremlin expressed a willingness to engage in discussions, but also noted that any resolution
would require convincing Putin that the conflict is unsustainable. Analysts are divided on how Trump
might handle the situation, with some suggesting he could pressure Putin by increasing U.S. oil
production or establishing a lend-lease program to arm Ukraine.

## Tech Companies Sign EU Hate Speed Pledge

X, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube, along with other platforms, have signed a voluntary EU pledge
to tackle illegal hate speech online. This commitment is part of a revised Code of Conduct
integrated into the Digital Services Act (DSA), aiming to enhance transparency and accountability in
content moderation.

### Key Points

- **Voluntary Commitment**: The pledge is not legally binding, meaning companies can withdraw
  without facing penalties. This was previously seen when Elon Musk withdrew X (formerly Twitter)
  from a similar agreement in 2022.
- **Signatories**: Besides X, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube, other platforms like TikTok, Twitch,
  Snapchat, LinkedIn, and Microsoft-hosted services have also signed the code.
- **Code of Conduct**: The updated code requires platforms to review at least two-thirds of hate
  speech notices within 24 hours and engage in transparency regarding hate speech detection and
  reduction. It also allows third-party monitoring of how platforms handle hate speech notices.
- **EU's Stance**: The EU emphasizes that there is no place for illegal hate, either offline or
  online, and cooperation among all parties is essential for a safe digital space. The code is part
  of broader efforts to ensure compliance with the DSA, which mandates effective systems for
  reporting and removing illegal content.
- **Political Context**: The announcement coincides with Donald Trump's return to the White House,
  which has put EU digital rules under scrutiny. Some, including X owner Elon Musk, have criticized
  the DSA as a tool of censorship.

This initiative reflects ongoing efforts to balance free speech with the need to curb harmful
content online, highlighting the complexities of digital regulation in a global context.
