## Biden to Pardon Nonviolent Drug Offenders

President Joe Biden has announced the commutation of sentences for nearly 2,500 individuals
convicted of nonviolent drug offenses. This action represents the broadest commutation of individual
sentences ever issued by a U.S. president and is part of Biden's efforts to address longstanding
disparities in the criminal justice system. This move sets a record for the most pardons and
sentence commutations in a single presidential term.

### Key Points

- **Purpose of Commutations**: The commutations target individuals who received disproportionately
  long sentences under outdated drug laws, particularly those involving crack versus powder cocaine.
  These laws have historically led to harsher penalties for crack cocaine offenses,
  disproportionately affecting Black communities.
- **Historical Context**: In the 1980s, Biden supported legislation that increased penalties for
  drug offenses, including those that created sentencing disparities between crack and powder
  cocaine. Over the years, Congress has attempted to address these disparities through the Fair
  Sentencing Act of 2010 and the First Step Act of 2018.
- **Biden's Clemency Record**: With this action, Biden has set a record for the most individual
  pardons and commutations issued by a U.S. president. This follows previous clemency actions,
  including commuting sentences for those on federal death row and individuals placed on home
  confinement during the pandemic.
- **Future Actions**: Biden has indicated that he may continue to review additional commutations and
  pardons before leaving office. This could include preemptive pardons for individuals who might be
  targeted by the incoming administration.

### Summary

President Biden's decision to commute the sentences of nearly 2,500 nonviolent drug offenders is a
significant step towards correcting historical injustices in the U.S. criminal justice system. By
addressing outdated sentencing laws and disparities, this action aims to provide relief to
individuals who have served disproportionately long sentences. Biden's use of clemency powers
underscores his commitment to criminal justice reform and sets a historic precedent in the use of
presidential pardoning powers. This move also highlights Biden's focus on providing opportunities
for individuals to reunite with their families and reintegrate into their communities.

## Career Catfishing by Gen Z

A recent report highlights a trend among Gen Z workers known as "career catfishing," where 34% of
them accept job offers but do not show up on the first day without notifying their employers. This
behavior is seen as a response to the frustrating job application process, which often involves
numerous applications, lengthy interviews, and slow responses from hiring managers. Gen Z workers
are using this tactic to assert control over their careers and prioritize their personal needs over
corporate demands.

The phenomenon is not limited to Gen Z, as 24% of Millennials, 11% of Gen X, and 7% of Baby Boomers
have also engaged in similar behavior. The trend reflects a broader shift in workplace dynamics,
where younger generations are more willing to challenge traditional corporate expectations and seek
autonomy.

The competitive job market, with fewer job listings and increased applications, is contributing to
this behavior. Many Gen Z workers feel pressured to accept the first job offer they receive, only to
later decide not to pursue it if a better opportunity arises. This trend is part of a larger pattern
of "ghosting" in the hiring process, where both employers and candidates abruptly cut off
communication.

Overall, while "career catfishing" allows Gen Z workers to feel empowered, it also risks damaging
their reputation with employers, who may view them as unreliable. The trend underscores the need for
improved communication and transparency in the hiring process to address the frustrations faced by
both job seekers and employers.

## China's Population Declines

China's population has declined for the third consecutive year, raising significant demographic
concerns. In 2024, the population decreased by 1.39 million, bringing the total to 1.408 billion.
This decline is attributed to a birthrate that continues to fall, despite government efforts to
reverse the trend. The National Bureau of Statistics reported that deaths have outpaced births since
2022, marking a demographic shift not seen since the Great Leap Forward in 1961.

Several factors contribute to this decline:

- **Economic and Social Pressures**: Rising living costs, a slowing economy, and high youth
  unemployment make raising children less appealing. Many young Chinese are delaying marriage and
  childbirth to pursue education and careers.
- **Policy Changes**: Although China ended its "one-child policy" in 2016 and now allows up to three
  children per family, these changes have not led to a significant increase in birthrates. Cultural
  preferences for male children have also resulted in a skewed sex ratio, with more males than
  females.
- **Aging Population**: The proportion of the population aged 65 and older has increased, adding
  pressure to the social security system. By 2035, it's expected that over 30% of the population
  will be over 60, prompting discussions about raising the retirement age.
- **Government Measures**: Beijing has implemented various measures to encourage childbirth, such as
  financial incentives and policy changes, but these have had limited success. The government is
  also gradually raising the retirement age to address the aging workforce.

China's demographic challenges are similar to those faced by other East Asian countries like Japan
and South Korea, where low birthrates and aging populations are common. These trends pose
significant challenges for China's future economic growth and social stability.

## Paraparticle Class Proposed

Researchers have proposed a new class of particles called "paraparticles," which exhibit unique
swapping behaviors that distinguish them from the well-known categories of fermions and bosons. This
theoretical prediction was made by Zhiyuan Wang from the Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics and
Kaden Hazzard from Rice University. Paraparticles are characterized by having internal degrees of
freedom that change when two of them are swapped, unlike fermions and bosons, whose properties
remain unchanged upon swapping.

The concept of paraparticles was initially mentioned by Wolfgang Pauli about a century ago but was
largely forgotten until recent theoretical advancements. Wang and Hazzard used the Yang-Baxter
equation, a mathematical formalism, to explore these particles, which could potentially appear as
quasiparticles in condensed-matter systems or as elementary particles in high-energy physics
experiments.

Paraparticles are not limited to two-dimensional systems like anyons, another type of particle with
swap-dependent internal states. They can exist in all dimensions, and their internal states reset
after swapping positions twice, unlike anyons. This unique behavior could have implications for
information storage, as the internal states of paraparticles could be used to store information
robustly against noise.

The discovery of paraparticles challenges the traditional dichotomy of fermions and bosons in
quantum mechanics and opens up new possibilities for exploring quantum phenomena. While practical
applications are not immediate, the theoretical framework developed by Wang and Hazzard lays the
groundwork for future research into these exotic particles and their potential uses in quantum
computing and information systems.

## Researchers Develop Advanced Bionic Hand Interface

Researchers have developed an advanced brain-computer interface (BCI) for bionic hands,
significantly enhancing touch sensations for users. This development involves intricate
collaborations among scientists from institutions like the University of Chicago, University of
Pittsburgh, and others. The technology uses intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) to evoke tactile
sensations by stimulating specific brain areas responsible for touch and movement.

Key advancements include the ability to create stable, localized, and strong touch sensations, which
are crucial for everyday tasks. By mapping brain areas corresponding to specific hand parts,
researchers can deliver precise electrical pulses to evoke sensations. This allows users to feel
pressure changes and even distinguish complex tactile shapes, improving their ability to manipulate
objects with a bionic hand.

The research also explores creating sensations of movement and shape by activating overlapping
sensory zones in the brain. This approach enables users to feel the boundaries of objects or the
motion across their skin, enhancing the immersive experience of using a bionic limb.

The ultimate goal of this research is to improve the independence and quality of life for
individuals with limb loss or paralysis. Future advancements may include more complex sensors and

## Russia Attacks Ukraine's Power Supply

Russia is facing serious accusations from Poland regarding alleged plots to attack airlines
globally. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk claimed that Russia was planning acts of air terror not
only against Poland but also against airlines worldwide. These accusations are part of a broader
pattern of suspicious incidents involving incendiary devices on cargo flights and other acts of
sabotage attributed to Russia.

In addition to these accusations, Russia has launched a series of missile strikes on Ukraine,
targeting its energy infrastructure. This has resulted in widespread power cuts across the country.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy reported that over 40 missiles were launched, with at least
30 being intercepted, and more than 70 attack drones were deployed overnight.

The missile strikes and the alleged airline attack plots are seen as part of Russia's broader
"hybrid" warfare strategy against Western targets, which includes cyber attacks, assassinations, and
other forms of sabotage. Western intelligence agencies have reportedly intercepted communications
suggesting Russian military involvement in these plots, although Russia has denied any involvement.

## SEC Lawsuit Against Elon Musk

In January 2025, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Elon
Musk, accusing him of securities violations related to his acquisition of Twitter, now renamed X.
The lawsuit alleges that Musk failed to disclose his ownership of more than 5% of Twitter's shares
in a timely manner in early 2022, which is a requirement under federal securities laws. This delay
in disclosure allowed Musk to purchase additional shares at artificially low prices, allegedly
saving him at least $150 million.

The SEC's complaint states that Musk began acquiring Twitter shares in early 2022 and had surpassed
the 5% ownership threshold by mid-March. However, he did not file the necessary disclosure with the
SEC until April 4, 2022, which was 11 days late. This delay allegedly caused economic harm to
investors who sold their shares at lower prices during this period.

The SEC is seeking disgorgement of the profits Musk gained from this alleged violation, along with
civil penalties. Musk has publicly criticized the SEC, calling the lawsuit a "sham" and accusing the
agency of being a "totally broken organization". His attorney, Alex Spiro, also dismissed the
lawsuit as an "admission" by the SEC that they cannot bring a substantial case against Musk.

This lawsuit is one of the final actions of the SEC under its outgoing chair, Gary Gensler, and it
remains uncertain whether the new administration will continue pursuing the case.

## Snakebite Treatment First Developed by AI

The development of new treatments for snakebite envenoming using artificial intelligence (AI) marks
a significant advancement in addressing a neglected public health issue. Snakebites affect millions
annually, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions, causing thousands of deaths and
permanent disabilities. Traditional antivenom production methods are outdated, costly, and not
always effective, leading to a socio-economic burden on poorer communities.

Researchers, including Tim Jenkins and Andreas Hougaard Laustsen-Kiel from the Technical University
of Denmark, are leveraging AI to develop more effective and affordable snakebite treatments. They
are using next-generation technologies, such as phage display and yeast display, to discover broadly

unless its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, sells the platform. This decision, which was
unanimous, is based on national security concerns related to TikTok's data collection practices and
its relationship with China. The ruling allows the federal government to shut down TikTok in the
U.S., a move that will take effect on January 19, 2025.

The court's decision follows a bipartisan bill signed by President Biden in April, which required
TikTok to either divest from ByteDance or cease operations in the U.S. TikTok challenged this law,
arguing it violated free speech rights, but the Supreme Court found that the national security risks
outweighed these concerns. The ruling is specific to TikTok and does not set a broad precedent for
other media companies.

The law prohibits U.S. companies, including Apple and Google, from offering TikTok on their app
stores, and web-hosting providers must sever ties with the platform or face significant fines. The
decision has created uncertainty about TikTok's future in the U.S., especially with the incoming
administration of President-elect Donald Trump, who has expressed interest in negotiating a
resolution to keep the app operational.

The Supreme Court's ruling emphasizes the government's interest in preventing China from accessing

## Yale Develops Novel Cancer Treatment

Yale scientists have developed a novel multi-target treatment approach that effectively reduces
tumor growth in four types of cancer: breast cancer, melanoma, pancreatic cancer, and colon cancer.
This new method targets multiple immune-suppressing genes simultaneously, addressing the complexity
of the tumor microenvironment, which traditional therapies often fail to do effectively.

Key aspects of this approach include:

- **Gene Editing with Cas13**: The researchers utilized a gene-editing molecule called Cas13, which
  targets and degrades RNA. This allows for the simultaneous targeting of multiple genes that
  suppress immune responses, effectively reactivating the immune system to fight the cancer.
- **Tumor Microenvironment Remodeling**: By delivering the Cas13 package into the tumor
  microenvironments in mice, the treatment silenced immune suppression genes, remodeled the
  microenvironment, and enhanced antitumor immune responses.
- **Broad Applicability**: The treatment showed effectiveness across multiple cancer types,
  suggesting it could benefit a wider range of patients compared to traditional therapies that often
  target a single molecule and benefit only a subset of patients.
- **Future Potential**: While further research is needed to optimize this approach for safety and
  efficacy, the technology holds promise as both a general "off-the-shelf" treatment and a
  personalized therapy by adjusting gene targets as needed.

The research, led by Sidi Chen and his team at Yale, represents a significant advancement in cancer
treatment, potentially offering more effective options for patients who do not respond to current
therapies. The findings were published in Nature Biotechnology on January 16, 2025.
