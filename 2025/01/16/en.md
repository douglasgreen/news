## Gold Nanoparticles May Reverse Parkinson's Disease

Gold nanoparticles have shown promise in reversing Parkinson's disease damage in mice by targeting
and healing damaged dopamine-producing brain cells. This innovative approach involves using
gold-shelled nanoparticles, approximately 160 nanometers in size, which are coated with antibodies
and peptide chemicals. These nanoparticles are designed to restore low dopamine levels and break
down harmful protein fibrils, specifically alpha-synuclein, which accumulate in the brains of
Parkinson's patients.

The nanoparticles are delivered into the brain and activated by near-infrared light, which they
absorb and convert into heat. This process triggers cellular changes that promote repair and release
peptides to clear out the alpha-synuclein fibrils. This method differs from traditional treatments
that primarily focus on boosting dopamine levels, which can lead to side effects over time. Instead,
the nanoparticles aim to 'reawaken' damaged neurons, reducing the need for drugs.

While this method has shown dramatic effects in mice, including restoring dopamine neurons and

## Russian Gas Supplies to Europe Halted

On January 1, 2025, Russia ceased its natural gas exports to Europe, marking the end of a
long-standing energy relationship that had persisted through the Cold War and into the 21st century.
This decision was influenced by the geopolitical tensions following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and
the subsequent Western sanctions imposed on Russia in 2022. In response, European countries began to
reduce their reliance on Russian gas, seeking alternative energy sources to ensure their energy
security.

The closure of the Yamal-Europe pipeline and the destruction of the Nord Stream pipelines left the
Druzhba pipeline, which ran through Ukraine, as the last remaining route for Russian gas to Europe.
However, Ukraine decided not to renew the transit contract with Russia, effectively ending the gas
flow. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described the termination of the deal as a significant
defeat for Russia, both economically and strategically.

The cessation of Russian gas exports has had varying impacts across Europe. While most European
countries had already diversified their energy sources, some regions, like Transnistria in Moldova,
are experiencing severe energy shortages. Moldova, which has historically relied on Russian gas, is
facing an energy crisis, exacerbated by its political tensions with Russia. The Moldovan government
accuses Russia of using energy as a tool for political leverage, especially with upcoming elections.

Russia's Gazprom has blamed Ukraine for the end of the transit deal, citing technical and legal
challenges. Meanwhile, Russia's Foreign Ministry has suggested that the United States is the primary
beneficiary of the situation, accusing it of orchestrating the energy market changes to its
advantage. Despite these challenges, Europe has largely managed to avoid a severe energy crisis by
securing alternative energy supplies, including liquefied natural gas from the United States.
