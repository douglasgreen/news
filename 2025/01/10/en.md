## China's Economy Grew at 5% in 2024

China's economy grew by 5% in 2024, meeting the government's target and surpassing some
expectations. This growth was driven by strong exports and a series of stimulus measures implemented
by the government. The economy showed significant improvement in the last quarter of the year, with
a growth rate of 5.4% from October to December.

Key factors contributing to this growth included a surge in exports, as companies and consumers
aimed to preempt potential tariff increases from the incoming U.S. administration. Manufacturing
played a crucial role, with industrial output increasing by 5.8% compared to the previous year.
Retail sales of consumer goods also saw a rise, growing at an annual rate of 3.5%.

Despite these positive developments, the Chinese economy faced challenges such as weaker consumer
spending and deflationary pressures. The property sector, once a major growth driver, continued to
struggle. Additionally, China's population declined for the third consecutive year, adding to
long-term growth pressures.

The government has been proactive in addressing these issues by implementing various stimulus
measures, including reducing banks' reserve requirements, cutting interest rates, and increasing
fiscal spending. These efforts aim to boost consumption and domestic demand, which are priorities
for the coming year.

Economists have expressed concerns about the sustainability of this growth, citing weak domestic
demand and a challenging external environment. They emphasize the need for broader structural
reforms to enhance productivity and reduce reliance on construction and export manufacturing.

## AI Useful in Early Detection of Breast Cancer

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) are showing significant promise in the early
detection of breast cancer. AI technologies are being integrated into breast cancer screening and
diagnostics, aiming to improve the accuracy and efficiency of these processes. Here are the key
points from the findings:

- **Improved Detection and Efficiency**: AI algorithms can enhance the interpretation of mammograms,
  ultrasounds, and MRI scans, making the detection of breast cancer more accurate and efficient.
  These tools can identify subtle abnormalities and patterns that might be missed by human eyes,
  thus potentially catching cancer at earlier stages.
- **Reduction in False Positives and Negatives**: AI can help reduce the number of unnecessary
  biopsies by decreasing false positives. It also aids in minimizing false negatives, ensuring that
  fewer cases of cancer go undetected.
- **Personalized Screening**: AI models like MIRAI are being developed to provide individualized
  risk assessments, which can lead to more personalized screening protocols. This approach is
  particularly beneficial for high-risk groups, such as younger women or those with dense breast
  tissue.
- **Remote and Equitable Access**: AI-powered imaging can facilitate remote diagnosis, which is
  crucial for patients in low-resource or rural areas. This technology ensures that patients receive
  timely and accurate diagnoses regardless of their location.
- **Challenges and Considerations**: Despite the potential, there are challenges in integrating AI
  into clinical practice. These include the need for extensive validation, data standardization,
  regulatory compliance, and addressing ethical considerations. Ensuring the reliability and
  interpretability of AI systems across different clinical settings is crucial for widespread
  adoption.

Overall, AI is poised to revolutionize breast cancer screening by making it faster, more accurate,
and more accessible, ultimately improving patient outcomes and saving lives. However, ongoing
research and validation are essential to fully realize its potential in clinical settings.

## Global Natural Disaster Loss Reached $320 Billion in 2024

The global natural disaster losses in 2024 reached $320 billion, marking a 30% increase from the
previous year. This significant rise in losses can be attributed to several factors, primarily
driven by climate change and its impact on weather patterns.

### Key Points

- **Climate Change Impact**: The increase in natural disaster losses is largely due to the effects
  of climate change. The year 2024 was the hottest on record, with temperatures around 1.5Â°C higher
  than pre-industrial levels. This warming has led to more severe weather events, including
  hurricanes, thunderstorms, and floods.
- **Weather Catastrophes**: In 2024, weather-related catastrophes accounted for 93% of the overall
  losses and 97% of insured losses. Major hurricanes in the USA, such as Hurricanes Helene and
  Milton, were among the most destructive, contributing significantly to the total losses.
- **Regional Impact**: North America experienced the highest share of global natural catastrophe
  losses, with extreme flooding and hurricanes causing substantial damage. Europe also faced severe
  flooding, particularly in Spain, while Asia-Pacific and Africa saw increased losses due to events
  like the earthquake in Japan and Typhoon Yagi.
- **Insurance and Economic Impact**: Of the $320 billion in total losses, $140 billion were insured.
  This highlights the growing financial burden on the insurance industry and the need for improved
  risk models and prevention strategies.

### Summary

The increase in global natural disaster losses in 2024 underscores the urgent need for societies to
adapt to the changing climate. The data suggests that climate change is intensifying weather events,
leading to higher economic and human costs. As such, there is a pressing need for enhanced
resilience and preparedness to mitigate the impact of future disasters.
