## Justin Trudeau Resignation

On January 6th, Justin Trudeau announced his resignation as the leader of the Liberal Party of
Canada and Prime Minister of Canada after nine years in office. He made this announcement during a
press conference, citing "internal battles" within his party as a significant reason for his
decision. Trudeau stated that he would remain in office until the Liberal Party selects a new leader
through a "robust nationwide competitive process".

Trudeau's resignation comes amid growing pressure from within his party and declining popularity
among Canadians. He acknowledged that his personal unpopularity was affecting the party's fortunes
ahead of the upcoming federal elections. Trudeau emphasized that the country deserves a real choice
in the next election and that he could not be the best option if he had to fight internal battles.

The Liberal Party's president, Sachit Mehra, announced that the party's board of directors would
meet to begin the process of selecting a new leader. Trudeau's resignation also led to the
prorogation of Parliament until March 24, allowing time for the leadership transition.

Trudeau's tenure included significant achievements such as the Canada Child Benefit, dental care,
and pharmacare coverage. However, his later years in office were marked by controversies, economic
challenges, and a loss of support from key allies, including Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia
Freeland.
