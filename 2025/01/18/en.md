## Biden Declares Equal Rights Amendment Law

President Joe Biden recently declared the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) as "the law of the land," a
symbolic gesture that has been celebrated by supporters but lacks formal legal effect. The ERA,
which aims to prohibit discrimination based on sex, was first proposed in 1923 and passed by
Congress in 1972. However, it faced a deadline for ratification by three-fourths of state
legislatures, which was not met until Virginia became the 38th state to ratify it in 2020, long
after the original deadline.

Despite Biden's declaration, the amendment's legal status remains uncertain. The National Archives
has stated that the ERA cannot be certified due to the expired deadline, and Biden has not directed
the archivist to certify it, avoiding a potential legal conflict over separation of powers. The
ERA's supporters argue that the deadline was not binding and continue to push for its recognition,
citing its importance in protecting against gender discrimination and supporting equal pay.

Biden's announcement comes as he prepares to leave office, and while it does not change the legal
standing of the ERA, it has reinvigorated discussions and advocacy around the amendment. Some legal
scholars and activists believe that Biden's statement could influence future legal arguments and
actions regarding the ERA.

### Summary

Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket successfully reached orbit on its first test flight, marking a
significant milestone for the company. The launch from Cape Canaveral was a spectacle, and the
mission involved sending a prototype satellite into orbit. Although the first-stage booster missed
its landing, the primary objective of reaching orbit was achieved. Blue Origin plans to conduct
multiple flights per year, aiming to lower the cost of space access and contribute to the new phase
of the space age.

## David Lynch Dies

David Lynch, the renowned filmmaker known for his surreal and visionary works such as "Twin Peaks,"
"Blue Velvet," and "Mulholland Drive," passed away at the age of 78. His death was announced by his
family in a Facebook post, though the specific cause and location were not immediately disclosed.
Lynch had been open about his battle with emphysema, a condition he was diagnosed with in 2024 after
a lifetime of smoking.

Lynch's career was marked by a distinctive style that blended elements of horror, film noir, and
surrealism, creating a unique cinematic language often described as "Lynchian." His work left a
significant impact on both film and television, influencing a wide range of media with its complex
narratives and atmospheric storytelling.

## North Korean Soldiers Captured in Ukraine

Ukrainian forces have captured two North Korean servicemen who were disguised as Russian soldiers
during the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. This event has revealed North Korea's involvement in the
war, which was previously thought to be solely between Ukraine and Russia.

### Key Points

- **Capture Details**: The two North Korean soldiers were captured in Russia's Kursk region by
  Ukrainian special forces. They were found injured and have been taken to Kyiv for interrogation by
  Ukraine's SBU intelligence agency, with assistance from South Korea's National Intelligence
  Service.
- **Disguise and Deployment**: The North Korean soldiers were given Russian military equipment,
  uniforms, and fake IDs to disguise their identity. They were part of a larger group of 12,000
  North Korean troops sent to support Russian forces.
- **Interrogation and Evidence**: During interrogation, one soldier claimed he was sent for
  training, not combat. The soldiers' capture provides evidence of North Korea's involvement in the
  conflict, which Ukraine is using to garner international support.
- **International Implications**: The involvement of North Korean troops highlights the broader
  geopolitical dynamics, with Ukraine suggesting that it is not just fighting Russia but a coalition
  of autocratic states, including North Korea, Iran, and China.
- **Military and Tactical Insights**: The captured soldiers revealed insights into North Korean
  tactics and their adaptation to modern warfare, including the use of drones and combined arms
  operations.

This incident underscores the complexity of the Ukraine conflict and the involvement of multiple
international actors, which could have significant implications for global security and diplomatic
relations.

## OpenAI Collaborates with Retro Biosciences

OpenAI, in collaboration with Retro Biosciences, has developed a new AI model named GPT-4b micro,
aimed at advancing protein engineering and longevity research. This initiative marks OpenAI's first
foray into biological research, focusing on enhancing the efficiency of stem cell production.

### Key Points

- **Model Development**: The GPT-4b micro model is designed to re-engineer proteins, specifically
  targeting the Yamanaka factors, which are crucial for converting adult cells into stem cells. This
  process has traditionally been inefficient, but the new model has shown to improve efficiency by
  up to 50 times.
- **Collaboration and Investment**: The project began after Retro Biosciences approached OpenAI for
  collaboration, with Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, having already invested $180 million in Retro. The
  partnership aims to extend the human lifespan by 10 years.
- **Scientific and Technological Impact**: Unlike Google DeepMind's AlphaFold, which predicts
  protein structures, GPT-4b focuses on protein interactions and engineering. This approach has
  allowed the model to propose significant modifications to proteins, surpassing human capabilities
  in designing functional proteins.
- **Potential Applications**: The advancements in protein engineering could pave the way for more
  efficient organ development and cell replacement therapies, potentially transforming longevity
  research and regenerative medicine.
- **Future Prospects**: OpenAI and Retro Biosciences plan to release their research findings,
  although the timeline is not specified. The model itself is not yet available for wider use,
  serving as a demonstration of capability rather than a commercial product.

This collaboration highlights the growing intersection between AI and life sciences, with the
potential to significantly impact our understanding of cellular biology and age-related diseases.

## Trump Launches Cryptocurrency

Donald Trump recently launched a meme cryptocurrency called $TRUMP, which has quickly gained
significant attention and market value. Here are the key points about this new venture:

- **Launch and Market Performance**: The $TRUMP coin was launched on the Solana blockchain network
  and has seen a rapid increase in value. Within hours of its launch, the coin's market
  capitalization surged to $4.25 billion, with a trading volume of $1 billion. The price of the coin
  increased by 220% shortly after its release.
- **Supply and Ownership**: Initially, 200 million $TRUMP coins were made available, with plans to
  expand the supply to 1 billion over the next three years. A significant portion of the coins is
  owned by Trump-affiliated companies, CIC Digital LLC and Fight Fight Fight LLC, which will benefit
  from trading revenues.
- **Purpose and Disclaimer**: The coin is marketed as a celebration of Trump's presidential election
  victory and upcoming inauguration. However, it is explicitly stated that $TRUMP is not intended as
  an investment opportunity or a security, and it is not associated with any political campaign or
  government agency.
- **Regulatory Context**: The launch of $TRUMP comes at a time when the regulatory environment for
  cryptocurrencies is evolving. Trump's administration has expressed intentions to reduce regulatory
  burdens on crypto firms and establish a crypto advisory council.
- **Ethical Considerations**: The launch of a meme coin by a sitting president raises ethical
  questions about the intersection of political influence and speculative financial assets. The
  pseudonymous nature of cryptocurrency investments adds complexity to these concerns.
- **Market Speculation**: There is speculation about whether $TRUMP can rival other popular meme
  coins like Dogecoin. While its initial performance is strong, the volatile nature of meme coins
  makes future predictions uncertain.

Overall, Trump's meme coin represents a blend of political branding and cryptocurrency speculation,
reflecting broader trends in the crypto market and regulatory landscape.
