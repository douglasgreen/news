## Australia's Mandatory Climate Reporting

2025-01-01

Australia has implemented mandatory climate reporting for companies starting in January 2025. This
initiative is part of a broader legislative effort to integrate climate-related risks and
opportunities into business strategies and reporting frameworks. Here are the key points regarding
this new requirement:

### Key Points

- **Legislation and Scope**: The mandatory climate reporting requirements were introduced through
  the Treasury Laws Amendment bill, which was passed by Australia's House of Representatives in
  September 2024. The legislation mandates large and medium-sized companies to disclose
  climate-related risks and opportunities, as well as greenhouse gas emissions across their value
  chains.
- **Implementation Timeline**: The reporting requirements will begin in January 2025 for the largest
  companies. These include public companies and large proprietary companies that meet specific size
  thresholds, such as having over 500 employees, revenues over $500 million, or assets over $1
  billion. Medium-sized companies will start reporting in July 2026, and smaller companies will
  follow a year later.
- **Phased Approach**: The legislation includes a phased-in approach for Scope 3 emissions
  reporting, which covers indirect emissions in a company's value chain. Companies will have an
  additional year from the start of their disclosure requirements to report these emissions, along
  with a three-year protection from litigation concerning Scope 3 disclosures.
- **Alignment with Global Standards**: The climate-related reporting requirements are aligned with
  the standards set by the IFRS Foundationâ€™s International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB).
  The Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) is developing climate disclosure standards for
  Australian companies, expected to be issued soon, and the Australian Auditing and Assurance Board
  (AUASB) is working on assurance standards for these disclosures.
- **Net Zero Economy Authority**: Alongside the climate reporting legislation, a new Net Zero
  Economy Authority has been established to guide Australia's transition to a net zero emissions
  economy. This authority will focus on reskilling workers, coordinating with industry and
  investors, and supporting regions in attracting new clean energy industries.

### Summary

Australia's mandatory climate reporting is a significant step towards enhancing transparency and
resilience in corporate operations by integrating climate-related risks into business strategies.
The phased implementation allows companies to gradually adapt to the new requirements, while
alignment with international standards ensures consistency and comparability in reporting. This
initiative is part of Australia's broader commitment to achieving net zero emissions by 2050.

  in managing migration. It also reflects the EU's trust in Bulgaria and Romania's ability to handle
  border security.

Overall, the full integration of Bulgaria and Romania into the Schengen Area marks a significant
milestone in their EU membership journey, enhancing mobility and economic opportunities while
maintaining security standards.

## New Year's Day Attack in New Orleans

2025-01-01

On New Year's Day in New Orleans, Louisiana, a tragic vehicle-ramming and shooting attack resulted
in the deaths of 15 people, including the perpetrator, and injuries to 35 others. The attacker,
identified as Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a 42-year-old Army veteran from Texas, drove a rented pickup truck
into a crowd on Bourbon Street, a popular tourist area in the French Quarter. The attack was
premeditated and is being investigated as an act of terrorism, with Jabbar reportedly inspired by
ISIS.

Jabbar managed to bypass police barricades and drove onto the sidewalk, aiming to hit as many people
as possible. After crashing the vehicle, he exited and opened fire on police officers with an
assault rifle. The police returned fire, killing Jabbar at the scene. Two police officers were
injured during the exchange.

The attack also involved potential explosive devices. Two functional improvised explosive devices
(IEDs) were found in coolers near the scene and were safely neutralized by bomb technicians.
Additional weapons and explosives were discovered in Jabbar's vehicle.

The incident has prompted a large-scale investigation involving the FBI, Homeland Security, and
local law enforcement. Authorities are examining Jabbar's background, including his military service
and potential connections to terror groups. Surveillance footage and social media posts by Jabbar
indicated his intent and inspiration from ISIS.

The attack has drawn national attention, with President Biden and other officials condemning the
violence and offering support to the victims and their families. The Sugar Bowl, a major college
football event scheduled nearby, was postponed due to security concerns.
