## Chorus Waves Discovered in Deep Space

Scientists have recently detected cosmic waves, known as chorus waves, in a region of space much
farther from Earth than previously observed. These waves, which sound like chirping birds when
converted to audio, were detected over 62,000 miles (100,000 kilometers) from Earth, a distance
where they had never been measured before.

Chorus waves are bursts of plasma that ripple at frequencies within the range of human hearing. They
have been detected in Earth's radiation belts and near other planets like Jupiter and Saturn. These
waves can produce high-energy electrons capable of affecting satellite communications.

The discovery was made using NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) satellites, which were launched
to study Earth's magnetic fields. The detection of these waves in a region where Earth's magnetic
field is stretched out raises new questions about their formation and the physics involved.

The presence of chorus waves in deep space suggests they could pose risks for long-distance space
travel, as they can accelerate electrons to high energies, potentially affecting spacecraft and
astronauts. Understanding these waves is crucial for predicting space weather and ensuring the
safety of future space missions.

## India Tests Scramjet Engine

India has recently achieved a significant milestone in its hypersonic missile development by
successfully conducting a ground test of a scramjet engine. This engine is crucial for the
development of next-generation hypersonic missiles capable of traveling at speeds exceeding Mach 5,
or five times the speed of sound. The scramjet engine, an air-breathing engine, allows for sustained
combustion at supersonic speeds without the need for moving parts, making it an improvement over
traditional ramjet technology.

The Defence Research and Development Laboratory (DRDL), a unit of India's Defence Research and
Development Organisation (DRDO), has been at the forefront of this development. They recently
demonstrated a long-duration supersonic combustion ramjet (scramjet) powered hypersonic technology
through a ground test that lasted 120 seconds. This test showcased successful ignition and stable
combustion, indicating the engine's potential for operational use in hypersonic vehicles.

Key achievements from the test include the development of an innovative flame stabilization
technique and the indigenous creation of scramjet fuel, which offers improved cooling and ease of
ignition. Additionally, a state-of-the-art thermal barrier coating was developed to withstand the
extreme temperatures encountered during hypersonic flight.

This development positions India alongside the United States, Russia, and China, who have already
developed technologies for hypersonic missiles. The successful test is a step towards enhancing
India's strategic capabilities, allowing it to bypass existing air defense systems and deliver
rapid, high-impact strikes.

    led to the fall of Assad's government, pushing toward Damascus and arriving in the capital
    before other groups.
2.  **Coordination with HTS:** Southern factions coordinated with HTS during the offensive, giving
    them a significant position in the new power structure.
3.  **Reluctance to Join Unified Army:** Some prominent Southern rebel leaders, like Ahmad al-Awda,
    are hesitant to participate in the national army and have refused to meet with the interim
    defense minister. This wariness highlights the challenges in bringing together the various
    groups and implies the southern rebels may seek to retain their independent power and influence.
4.  **Southern Syria as a Cradle of Rebellion:** The southern province of Daraa is considered the
    birthplace of the Syrian uprising, suggesting that the Southern rebels have strong local roots
    and influence.
5.  **Potential for Independent Action:** The southern rebels have shown a willingness to act
    independently, as seen in their push towards Damascus. They have not shown a willingness to
    follow the orders of other groups.

  groups with different agendas and ideologies.
- **Southern Rebel Hesitancy:** The reluctance of some Southern commanders to participate in the
  national army raises concerns about the government's ability to build a unified force.
- **Maintaining Stability:** The differing factions and their leaders need to be unified or managed
  effectively to ensure long-term stability and a successful transition to a new government.

**In conclusion:** Southern rebels are gaining influence in Syria due to their crucial role in the
recent offensive and their established presence in the region. However, their hesitance to fully
integrate into a unified national army presents a challenge for the interim government in forming a
cohesive national military and maintaining stability in the country.

## Trump Signs Order to Delay TikTok Ban

President Donald Trump signed an executive order delaying the enforcement of a federal ban on TikTok
for 75 days. This move provides TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, additional
time to comply with a law that requires its sale or ban due to national security concerns. The law
had taken effect the previous day, but Trump's order instructs the attorney general not to enforce
it immediately, allowing his administration to explore potential solutions, including a sale of
TikTok to a non-Chinese owner.

The executive order has sparked debate over its legality, as it attempts to override a law upheld by
the Supreme Court. Critics argue that this sets a dangerous precedent by undermining the rule of
law. Meanwhile, TikTok remains operational in the U.S., though it faces challenges such as the
inability to update the app through Apple and Google stores, which could degrade its performance
over time.

Trump's decision has also raised questions about the potential for a joint venture between the U.S.
and ByteDance, with Trump suggesting that the U.S. should have a 50% stake if a deal is reached. The
situation remains fluid, with the possibility of legal challenges to the executive order and ongoing
discussions about TikTok's future ownership and operation in the U.S.

## Trump Signs Order to End Birthright Citizenship

President Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship in the
United States, a move that has sparked significant legal challenges and controversy. Birthright
citizenship, enshrined in the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, grants automatic citizenship
to anyone born on U.S. soil, regardless of their parents' immigration status. Trump's order seeks to
reinterpret this amendment to exclude children born to parents who are unlawfully present in the
U.S. or who are in the country on temporary visas.

The executive order has been met with immediate legal opposition. A coalition of 18 Democratic state
attorneys general, along with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), have filed lawsuits arguing
that the order is unconstitutional. They assert that the 14th Amendment's language has been
interpreted for over a century to include all children born in the U.S., and that Trump's order
unlawfully attempts to change this settled law.

The order, if implemented, would deny citizenship to children born in the U.S. to parents without
legal status or on temporary visas, potentially affecting around 150,000 children born each year. It
would also impact the issuance of key documents like passports and social security numbers, and
could affect access to certain benefits.

Legal experts widely agree that Trump's attempt to end birthright citizenship through an executive
order is unlikely to succeed without a constitutional amendment, which would require significant
legislative support. The legal battle is expected to reach the Supreme Court, where the longstanding
interpretation of the 14th Amendment will be scrutinized.

## US Will Withdraw from World Health Organization

On January 20, 2025, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to withdraw the United States
from the World Health Organization (WHO). This decision marks the second attempt by the Trump
administration to exit the WHO, following a similar move during his first term that was reversed by
President Joe Biden.

### Key Points

- **Executive Order Details**: The order directs the U.S. to withdraw from WHO membership, halt
  future funding, recall U.S. personnel working with WHO, and end negotiations on the Pandemic
  Agreement and amendments to the International Health Regulations.
- **Impact on WHO**: The U.S. is one of the largest donors to WHO, providing significant funding and
  technical expertise. The withdrawal could affect WHO's operations and its ability to implement
  reforms and respond to global health emergencies.
- **Implications for the U.S.**: The U.S. will lose its influence in international health
  negotiations and may face challenges in accessing timely information and cooperation during health
  crises. This could impact the country's ability to protect its citizens from global health
  threats.
- **WHO's Response**: The WHO expressed regret over the U.S. decision, highlighting the
  long-standing partnership and contributions of the U.S. to global health initiatives. WHO hopes
  for a reconsideration and continued collaboration.

This withdrawal reflects the Trump administration's broader "America First" policy, emphasizing
unilateral actions if international organizations do not align with U.S. values.

## Zelensky Calls for 200,000 Peacekeepers After Ceasefire

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called for at least 200,000 European peacekeepers to be
deployed in Ukraine to ensure security following any potential ceasefire agreement with Russia.
Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Zelenskyy emphasized that this number is
the minimum required to prevent a new Russian attack, given the proximity of European countries to
Russia and the size of the Russian military.

Zelenskyy highlighted that Ukraine's best defense during a ceasefire would be its membership in
NATO, although this is opposed by Germany, the U.S., Hungary, and Slovakia. He also urged European
nations to increase their defense spending to 5% of GDP, aligning with former U.S. President Donald
Trump's call for NATO members to bolster their defense budgets.

The Ukrainian leader is seeking a meeting with Trump, who has promised to end the war swiftly,
though details on how this would be achieved remain unclear. Zelenskyy rejected Russia's demand for
Ukraine to reduce its military size significantly, stating that such a concession is unacceptable.
