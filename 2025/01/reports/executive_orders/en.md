On January 20, 2025, the President issued a memorandum to pause and review new regulations. This order applies to all executive departments and agencies, instructing them not to propose or issue any new rules until they are reviewed and approved by a department or agency head appointed by the President.

Additionally, it suggests postponing the effective date of any published rules that have not yet taken effect for 60 days to allow for further review and public comment.

The memorandum defines "rules" broadly, including any regulatory actions or guidance documents that could lead to a final rule or regulation. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director is responsible for overseeing the implementation of this memorandum and can exempt rules necessary for emergencies. The OMB Director can also establish a process to review pending information collections under the Paperwork Reduction Act. If any actions taken before the memorandum's issuance undermine its purpose, the President may modify or extend the memorandum to address those actions.

This regulatory freeze is a common practice for new administrations, allowing them to review and potentially alter the regulatory landscape set by the previous administration. It aims to ensure that new leadership has the opportunity to assess and align regulations with the current administration's priorities.

## Hiring Freeze (Presidential Actions, January 20, 2025)

However, this freeze does not affect military personnel or positions related to immigration enforcement, national security, or public safety. Social Security, Medicare, and Veterans' benefits will not be impacted by this freeze. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) can grant exemptions if necessary.

Within 90 days, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in consultation with the Director of OPM and the Administrator of the United States DOGE Service (USDS), must submit a plan to reduce the federal workforce through efficiency improvements and attrition. Once this plan is issued, the hiring freeze will end for all executive departments and agencies, except for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The freeze for the IRS will continue until the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Director of OMB and the Administrator of USDS, decides it is in the national interest to lift it. The memorandum also prohibits contracting outside the federal government to bypass the freeze.

The memorandum encourages efficient use of existing personnel and funds to improve public services and does not restrict reallocating resources to meet high-priority needs. It also does not limit the appointment of officials to positions requiring Presidential appointment or Senate confirmation, nor does it affect non-career positions or temporary hiring authority. Additionally, it does not override any existing collective bargaining agreements.

## Delivering Emergency Price Relief for American Families and Defeating the Cost-of-Living Crisis (Presidential Actions, January 20, 2025)

This directive criticizes the previous Biden Administration for causing inflation through excessive government spending and regulations that limited the availability of essential goods and services. The directive highlights the increased costs of energy, housing, and other necessities, attributing these to regulatory burdens and policies that have weakened American production.

To address these issues, the directive orders executive departments and agencies to take actions to lower housing costs, reduce healthcare expenses, and eliminate regulations that increase the cost of home appliances. It also aims to create more job opportunities and remove policies that raise food and fuel prices. The Assistant to the President for Economic Policy is tasked with reporting on the progress of these initiatives every 30 days.

The directive emphasizes the need to restore purchasing power and improve the quality of life for American families.

## Application Of Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act To TikTok (Presidential Actions, January 20, 2025)

The executive order issued on January 20, 2025, by the President of the United States addresses the application of the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act to TikTok. This Act aims to regulate applications controlled by foreign adversaries, specifically targeting TikTok and its parent company, ByteDance Ltd., due to national security concerns. The Act prohibits the distribution, maintenance, or updating of such applications within the U.S. through online stores or hosting services. These prohibitions took effect on January 19, 2025, just before the new President took office.

The President has expressed concerns about the timing of the Act's enforcement, which interferes with the ability to assess its national security implications and negotiate a resolution to prevent TikTok's abrupt shutdown. To address this, the President has ordered a 75-day pause on enforcing the Act, allowing time to evaluate the situation and determine a suitable course of action. During this period, the Department of Justice will not enforce the Act or impose penalties for noncompliance. The Attorney General is instructed to issue guidance and letters to providers, ensuring no liability for actions taken during this pause.

The executive order emphasizes the President's responsibility for national security and foreign policy, highlighting the need for a careful review of TikTok's impact on national security. The order also asserts the exclusive authority of the Executive Branch to enforce the Act, preventing states or private parties from attempting enforcement. This pause aims to balance national security concerns with the continued availability of a platform used by millions of Americans.

## Withdrawing The United States From The World Health Organization (Presidential Actions, January 20, 2025)

On January 20, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order to withdraw the United States from the World Health Organization (WHO). This decision was based on criticisms of the WHO's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and other global health crises, as well as concerns about the organization's political independence and financial demands on the U.S. The order revokes previous actions that had retracted the U.S.'s withdrawal notice and calls for halting U.S. funding and support to the WHO, recalling U.S. personnel, and finding alternative partners to take over WHO's roles.

The executive order outlines several actions, including revoking a previous executive order related to COVID-19 response and establishing new mechanisms within the National Security Council to protect public health. It also directs the Secretary of State to notify the United Nations and WHO leadership of the withdrawal and to stop negotiations on the WHO Pandemic Agreement.

The withdrawal from WHO could have significant implications for global health and U.S. influence in international health matters. The U.S. has been a major contributor to WHO, providing financial support and technical expertise. Without U.S. involvement, there may be challenges in global health coordination, disease surveillance, and response to health emergencies. The decision also reflects a broader shift in U.S. foreign policy towards a more unilateral approach.

## Restoring Accountability To Policy-Influencing Positions Within the Federal Workforce (Presidential Actions, January 20, 2025)

On January 20, 2025, an executive order was issued to restore accountability in policy-influencing positions within the federal workforce. The order highlights the President's authority over the executive branch and emphasizes the need for professionalism and accountability among federal employees, especially those in positions that influence policy. It points out that many supervisors lack confidence in their ability to remove employees for misconduct or poor performance, which undermines accountability. The order reinstates a previous policy, known as Schedule F, which reclassifies certain federal employees to make it easier to remove them if they do not align with the administration's policies.

The executive order makes several amendments to the previous policy, renaming Schedule F to Schedule Policy/Career and specifying that employees in these positions must implement administration policies faithfully, regardless of personal or political beliefs. The order also revokes a previous executive order that protected federal workforce rights and directs the Office of Personnel Management to amend regulations that conflict with the new order. Additionally, it requires the identification of more positions that should be considered for the new classification, aiming to ensure that those in policy-influencing roles are directly accountable to the President.

Overall, the executive order seeks to streamline the process of holding federal employees accountable, particularly those in influential positions, by reinstating and modifying a previous policy. It aims to ensure that these employees are aligned with the administration's goals and can be removed if they fail to implement policies effectively. This move has sparked debate about the potential for increased political influence over traditionally apolitical civil service roles.

## Holding Former Government Officials Accountable For Election Interference And Improper Disclosure Of Sensitive Governmental Information (Presidential Actions, January 20, 2025)

On January 20, 2025, an executive order was issued to hold former government officials accountable for election interference and improper disclosure of sensitive information. This order was a response to actions taken during the 2020 Presidential campaign, where 51 former intelligence officials coordinated with the Biden campaign to discredit a news story about President Biden's son. The letter they issued falsely suggested the story was Russian disinformation, and it was reviewed by the CIA before publication. This misuse of intelligence authority was seen as a breach of trust and an attempt to manipulate the political process.

The executive order also addressed the issue of classified information being disclosed for personal gain. Former National Security Advisor John R. Bolton published a memoir containing sensitive information, which was seen as undermining national security and the ability of future presidents to receive candid advice. To address these issues, the order revoked the security clearances of the involved former intelligence officials and John R. Bolton. It emphasized that the Intelligence Community should not engage in partisan politics or use security clearances to influence elections.

The order directed the Director of National Intelligence and the CIA to revoke the clearances of specific individuals and report any further inappropriate activities within 90 days. It also outlined policies to prevent future misuse of intelligence for political purposes and the improper disclosure of classified information. The order aimed to restore trust in the Intelligence Community and ensure that national security information is handled responsibly.

To address this, the President has ordered the use of the U.S. Armed Forces to support the Department of Homeland Security in securing the border.

The proclamation outlines several actions to be taken. It directs the deployment of military personnel and resources to assist in controlling the border. This includes constructing additional physical barriers and using unmanned aerial systems to monitor the area.

## Memorandum to Resolve the Backlog of Security Clearances for Executive Office of the President Personnel (Presidential Actions, January 20, 2025)

The memorandum addresses a backlog in processing security clearances for personnel in the Executive Office of the President, which has been causing delays in their ability to perform their duties. This backlog was created during the Biden Administration and has resulted in some individuals being unable to access necessary facilities and technology. To resolve this issue, the President has ordered that certain personnel be granted interim Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) security clearances for up to six months. This will allow them immediate access to the resources they need to fulfill their roles.

The White House Counsel is tasked with providing a list of these individuals to the White House Security Office and Acting Chief Security Officer. The Counsel also has the authority to add more names to this list as needed and can revoke any interim clearances if necessary.

Overall, this action aims to expedite the security clearance process for essential personnel, ensuring that they can carry out their responsibilities without unnecessary delays. The President is using his authority to bypass the traditional, slower clearance procedures temporarily, highlighting the importance of efficiency in government operations.

## Realigning the United States Refugee Admissions Program (Presidential Actions, January 20, 2025)

On January 20, 2025, an executive order was issued to realign the United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP). This order suspends the program due to the high levels of migration that have overwhelmed various U.S. cities and towns. The suspension aims to ensure that the entry of refugees aligns with the national interests, focusing on public safety, national security, and the proper assimilation of refugees. The order also emphasizes the need to preserve resources for American citizens and suggests that state and local governments should have a say in refugee placements within their jurisdictions.

The executive order mandates that the entry of refugees under the USRAP is halted until further notice, with exceptions allowed on a case-by-case basis if deemed in the national interest.

This suspension of the USRAP represents a significant shift in U.S. refugee policy, potentially delaying future refugee arrivals and altering the longstanding federal authority over refugee admissions. The order underscores the importance of involving state and local jurisdictions in resettlement decisions, which could lead to changes in how refugees are placed across the country. The overall goal is to ensure that refugee admissions do not compromise the safety, security, and resources of American communities.

## Protecting The Meaning And Value Of American Citizenship (Presidential Actions, January 20, 2025)

On January 20, 2025, an executive order was issued to redefine the criteria for birthright citizenship in the United States. The order emphasizes that U.S. citizenship is a valuable privilege and aims to restrict automatic citizenship for certain individuals born in the U.S. Specifically, it targets children born to mothers who are either unlawfully present in the U.S. or temporarily present (such as on a tourist or student visa) if the father is not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident. This order seeks to ensure that citizenship is not automatically granted in these cases, aligning with a specific interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment.

The policy outlined in the executive order prevents federal agencies from issuing or recognizing documents that confer U.S. citizenship to individuals falling under the specified categories. This policy is set to apply to individuals born in the U.S. after 30 days from the order's issuance. However, it does not affect the citizenship rights of children born to lawful permanent residents. The order also mandates that relevant government departments align their regulations and policies with this new directive and provide public guidance on its implementation.

This executive order has sparked legal challenges, with critics arguing that it contradicts the Fourteenth Amendment, which has historically granted citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil, regardless of their parents' immigration status. Legal actions have been taken to block the order, with courts issuing preliminary injunctions to prevent its implementation. The controversy centers around the interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment and the potential implications for children born in the U.S. under the new criteria.

The order emphasizes the need to protect the nation by stopping illegal immigration and the flow of illicit materials across the border. It outlines a policy to use all available resources to secure the borders, including building physical barriers, detaining illegal immigrants, and cooperating with state and local law enforcement.

The order specifies several actions to achieve these goals. It calls for the construction of physical barriers along the southern border and the deployment of personnel to ensure control. It also mandates the detention of illegal immigrants until they are removed from the country and the resumption of the Migrant Protection Protocols. Additionally, it seeks to adjust parole policies and enhance international cooperation to manage immigration more effectively.

It seeks to address the challenges posed by illegal immigration by implementing a comprehensive approach that includes physical barriers, increased personnel, and legal measures. The order underscores the importance of protecting national security and public safety by controlling the borders and managing immigration effectively.

## Putting People Over Fish: Stopping Radical Environmentalism to Provide Water to Southern California (Presidential Actions, January 20, 2025)

President Trump issued a memorandum directing the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Interior to restart efforts from his previous administration to redirect water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to Central and Southern California. This action aims to provide a more reliable water supply to these regions, which have been affected by wildfires and water scarcity. The memorandum criticizes previous environmental regulations that protected fish species like the Delta smelt, arguing that these rules have led to water being wasted by flowing into the Pacific Ocean instead of being used for human needs.

During Trump's first term, California's government opposed his water infrastructure plans, citing environmental concerns. The recent memorandum emphasizes the need to prioritize human water needs over environmental protections, especially in light of the destructive wildfires in Southern California. Trump has given the Secretaries 90 days to report on the progress of implementing these policies and to provide recommendations for future actions.

The memorandum has sparked controversy, with environmental groups and some officials arguing that it overlooks the ecological importance of the Delta and its species. Critics also point out that the current water management rules, developed under the Biden and Newsom administrations, aim to balance water distribution while protecting the environment. These rules reportedly provide more water to Southern California than Trump's previous regulations. The debate highlights ongoing tensions between environmental conservation and resource management in California.

## Restoring The Death Penalty And Protecting Public Safety (Presidential Actions, January 20, 2025)

The executive order titled "Restoring the Death Penalty and Protecting Public Safety" was issued by the President on January 20, 2025. It emphasizes the importance of capital punishment as a deterrent and punishment for severe crimes. The order criticizes previous actions by politicians and judges, particularly those by President Biden, who had placed a moratorium on federal executions and commuted the sentences of several individuals on death row.

The executive order issued on January 20, 2025, aims to reinforce the recognition of biological sex as the basis for federal policies and laws, distinguishing it from gender identity. It asserts that there are only two sexes, male and female, which are immutable and grounded in biological reality. The order criticizes what it calls "gender ideology," which it claims undermines the biological reality of sex by allowing individuals to self-identify their gender, thus affecting laws and policies designed to protect sex-based opportunities. The administration plans to use clear language and policies to ensure that women are recognized as biologically female and men as biologically male.

The order outlines specific policies and definitions to be used by federal agencies, emphasizing that "sex" refers to an individual's biological classification and is not synonymous with "gender identity."

It rescinds previous executive orders and guidance that supported gender identity recognition and mandates that federal agencies prioritize the enforcement of sex-based distinctions. The order also requires agencies to report on their implementation progress and to ensure that federal funds are not used to promote gender ideology. Overall, the order represents a significant policy shift towards reinforcing traditional definitions of sex and limiting the recognition of gender identity within federal programs and policies.

This action is based on the authority granted by the U.S. Constitution and laws such as the Immigration and Nationality Act and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The order identifies these cartels as significant threats to national security, citing their involvement in violent activities, drug trafficking, and their influence over illegal border traffic.

## Keeping Americans Safe in Aviation (Presidential Actions, January 21, 2025)

The text discusses a presidential directive aimed at ensuring safety in aviation by addressing hiring practices within the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The FAA is responsible for overseeing the safety of numerous flights and millions of passengers daily. However, the text criticizes the previous administration for prioritizing diversity and inclusion over merit-based hiring, which allegedly compromised safety by recruiting individuals with disabilities that could affect their job performance.

The directive orders the FAA to revert to hiring based on merit, competence, and qualifications, rather than diversity criteria such as race, sex, or disability. It emphasizes that all diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives that could endanger safety should be rescinded.

## Designation Of Ansar Allah as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (Presidential Actions, January 22, 2025)

On January 22, 2025, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to designate Ansar Allah, also known as the Houthis, as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO). This decision was made due to the group's ongoing attacks on U.S. Navy warships, civilian infrastructure, and commercial vessels, which have endangered American personnel and disrupted global trade. The Houthis, supported by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, have been involved in numerous violent activities since 2014, including attacks on Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Israel.

## Executive Grant of Clemency for Terence Sutton (Presidential Actions, January 22, 2025)

On January 22, 2025, President Donald J. Trump issued a full and unconditional pardon to Terence Sutton, a police officer from Washington, D.C. Sutton was previously convicted in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for several charges, including second-degree murder and obstruction of justice, related to a police chase that resulted in the death of Karon Hylton-Brown in 2020. Sutton was sentenced to over five years in prison for these offenses. The pardon effectively nullifies Sutton's convictions and any associated penalties, allowing him to avoid serving his prison sentence.

The decision to pardon Sutton has sparked significant controversy and debate. Critics argue that the pardon undermines the judicial process and could be seen as an abuse of presidential power. The case was particularly sensitive due to its timing, occurring shortly after the murder of George Floyd, which had already heightened tensions around police conduct and accountability. The pardon has been criticized by some as potentially eroding public trust in law enforcement and the justice system, as it may be perceived as excusing or minimizing serious misconduct by police officers.

Supporters of the pardon, including the D.C. Police Union, argue that the convictions were unjust and that the officers were unfairly targeted. They claim that the charges against Sutton and his colleague, Lt. Andrew Zabavsky, who was also pardoned, were excessive and that the officers were simply performing their duties. The union and other advocates believe that the pardons correct a miscarriage of justice and support law enforcement officers who face challenging situations in the line of duty.

## Federal Recognition of the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina (Presidential Actions, January 23, 2025)

The Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina, known as the People of the Dark Water, has a rich history and is descended from several tribal nations, including the Hatteras, Tuscarora, and Cheraw. Despite being recognized by the state of North Carolina as an Indian tribe in 1885, the Lumbee have not received full federal recognition, which would grant them access to federal benefits. In 1956, the Lumbee Act acknowledged them as Indians but denied them these benefits. The tribe, now consisting of over 55,000 members, is the largest east of the Mississippi River and the ninth-largest in the United States.

In 2024, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Lumbee Fairness Act, which aimed to grant the tribe full federal recognition, but the Senate did not consider it before the end of the 118th Congress. The U.S. government now supports the full federal recognition of the Lumbee Tribe, acknowledging their historical and modern significance. A directive has been issued for the Secretary of the Interior to create a plan within 90 days to assist the Lumbee Tribe in obtaining full federal recognition, exploring legal pathways such as congressional acts, judicial actions, or administrative procedures.

The memorandum emphasizes the importance of recognizing the Lumbee Tribe and ensuring they receive the benefits associated with federal recognition. This includes a thorough review of potential legal avenues to achieve this goal, highlighting the need for collaboration between the Lumbee Tribe and the U.S. government. The Secretary of the Interior is tasked with publishing this memorandum in the Federal Register, marking a significant step toward addressing the longstanding issue of federal recognition for the Lumbee Tribe.

The order also prohibits the establishment and use of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) within the U.S., citing concerns over financial stability and privacy.

The executive order revokes previous policies from the Biden administration, specifically Executive Order 14067 and the Treasury's framework on digital assets. It establishes a President's Working Group on Digital Asset Markets to review existing regulations and propose a federal regulatory framework for digital assets, including stablecoins. This group, chaired by a Special Advisor for AI and Crypto, will include various high-level officials and is tasked with submitting a report within 180 days. The report will focus on market structure, consumer protection, and risk management, and will evaluate the potential for a national digital asset stockpile.

Overall, the order seeks to provide regulatory clarity and support innovation in the digital asset space while safeguarding against potential risks associated with CBDCs. It aims to position the U.S. as a leader in digital financial technology by fostering an environment conducive to growth and innovation, with a focus on maintaining the sovereignty of the U.S. dollar and protecting individual privacy.

## Declassification of Records Concerning the Assassinations of President John F. Kennedy (Presidential Actions, January 23, 2025)

On January 23, 2025, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to declassify all records related to the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. This decision comes more than 50 years after these events, with the aim of providing transparency and truth to the families of the victims and the American public. The order mandates the release of all records concerning JFK's assassination within 15 days and those related to RFK and MLK Jr. within 45 days.

The President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 required the full disclosure of JFK-related records by 2017, unless withholding them was necessary to prevent identifiable harm to national interests. Despite previous administrations, including President Biden's, delaying the release of some documents, President Trump has determined that further withholding is not in the public interest. Although there is no congressional mandate for the release of RFK and MLK Jr. records, Trump has decided that their disclosure is also in the public interest.

The executive order specifies that the Director of National Intelligence and the Attorney General, along with other officials, must coordinate the release plans. This move is part of Trump's broader promise to end delays and provide the American people with the truth about these historical events.

## President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (Presidential Actions, January 23, 2025)

The executive order establishes the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) to provide guidance on science and technology matters.

PCAST will consist of up to 24 members from various sectors, co-chaired by the Assistant to the President for Science and Technology and the Special Advisor for AI and Crypto.

PCAST's role is to advise the President on science, technology, education, and innovation policies. It will gather information from diverse stakeholders, including academia, industry, and government, to inform public policy. The council will also serve as advisory committees for specific acts related to high-performance computing and nanotechnology. Members will serve without compensation but may receive travel expenses. The Department of Energy will support PCAST administratively and financially.

The order revokes a previous executive order from 2021 and sets a two-year term for PCAST, with the possibility of extension. This initiative underscores the administration's commitment to leveraging science and technology for national security and economic growth.

## Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence (Presidential Actions, January 23, 2025)

The Executive Order titled "Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence," issued on January 23, 2025, aims to strengthen the United States' position as a global leader in artificial intelligence (AI). The order emphasizes the importance of developing AI systems that are free from ideological bias and engineered social agendas. It seeks to enhance America's global AI dominance to promote human flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national security. To achieve this, the order revokes certain existing AI policies that are seen as barriers to innovation and mandates the creation of an AI Action Plan within 180 days.

The order tasks key White House officials, including the Assistant to the President for Science and Technology and the Special Advisor for AI and Crypto, with reviewing and potentially revising or rescinding actions taken under the previous administration's AI policies. This includes the revocation of Executive Order 14110, which focused on the safe and trustworthy development of AI. The officials are required to identify any actions that conflict with the new policy and take steps to align them with the current administration's objectives. Additionally, the Office of Management and Budget is instructed to revise its guidance on AI to ensure consistency with the new policy.

Overall, the Executive Order reflects a shift in AI policy towards fostering innovation and maintaining U.S. leadership in AI technology. It underscores the administration's commitment to removing regulatory barriers and promoting a free-market approach to AI development. The order also highlights the potential for increased state-level regulation in the absence of comprehensive federal legislation, as states may seek to address AI-related issues independently.

## The First 100 Hours: Historic Action to Kick off America’s Golden Age (Presidential Actions, January 24, 2025)

President Donald Trump began his second term with a series of rapid and significant actions, focusing on fulfilling his campaign promises. Within the first 100 hours, he signed numerous executive orders aimed at securing the U.S. border, deporting criminal illegal immigrants, and boosting the economy through significant investments. Trump also emphasized reducing government costs, increasing transparency, and reinstating merit-based hiring in the federal government. His administration secured over $1 trillion in new investments, including a $500 billion AI infrastructure project and a $600 billion investment from Saudi Arabia.

In terms of immigration, Trump's administration took aggressive steps to secure the border and deport illegal immigrants with criminal records. The Border Patrol reported a decrease in illegal crossings, and ICE arrested hundreds of illegal immigrants with criminal histories. Trump also shut down the CBP One app, which had allowed over a million illegal immigrants to enter the U.S., and began deportation flights with military assistance. Additionally, he reinstated the use of the term "illegal alien" and took action against sanctuary city policies.

Trump's executive orders also targeted energy policies, reversing many of Joe Biden's regulations and withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement. He declared a National Energy Emergency to maximize America's energy potential and reduce costs. Furthermore, Trump ended affirmative action mandates in federal hiring, emphasized merit-based hiring, and directed federal employees to return to office work. His actions were praised by various industry leaders for supporting American jobs, energy independence, and reducing government interference.

## Council to Assess the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Presidential Actions, January 24, 2025)

The executive order issued on January 24, 2025, by President Trump establishes a council to review the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). This decision comes after recent disasters, such as Hurricane Helene, highlighted the need for significant improvements in FEMA's effectiveness and priorities. Concerns have been raised about FEMA's political bias and its focus on missions beyond its scope, which may have affected its ability to provide timely and impartial disaster response. The council will consist of up to 20 members, including the Secretaries of Homeland Security and Defense, and will include experts from various sectors to provide diverse perspectives on disaster management.

The council's primary role is to advise the President on FEMA's current capabilities and suggest changes to enhance its performance. It will regularly meet to gather information from a wide range of stakeholders, including those affected by disasters, and will produce a comprehensive report. This report will assess FEMA's disaster response over the past four years, compare it with state and local responses, and evaluate FEMA's role within the federal system. The council will also explore historical disaster relief methods and consider whether FEMA should act as a support agency rather than taking over state responsibilities.

The council is expected to hold its first public meeting within 90 days of the order and submit its findings to the President within 180 days of this meeting. The Department of Homeland Security will provide necessary support, and council members will serve without compensation, although they may receive travel expenses. The council will be dissolved one year from the order's date unless extended by the President. This initiative aims to ensure FEMA can deliver effective and unbiased disaster relief, aligning with national interests and resilience goals.

## Emergency Measures to Provide Water Resources in California and Improve Disaster Response in Certain Areas (Presidential Actions, January 24, 2025)

The executive order issued on January 24, 2025, by the President of the United States aims to address the severe water shortages and improve disaster response in California, particularly in Southern California, which has been devastated by wildfires. The order outlines several measures to ensure adequate water resources are available to fight and prevent wildfires.

Furthermore, the executive order includes specific actions to assist families in North Carolina affected by Hurricane Helene, such as clearing roads and providing housing relief. The order concludes with general provisions ensuring that the actions taken are consistent with existing laws and do not create new legal rights or benefits. Overall, the order seeks to provide immediate relief and long-term solutions to improve water resource management and disaster response in affected areas.

## Enforcing the Hyde Amendment (Presidential Actions, January 24, 2025)

On January 24, 2025, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to enforce the Hyde Amendment, which has been a longstanding policy preventing federal funding for elective abortions. This order aims to reverse actions taken by the previous administration, which had allowed federal taxpayer dollars to fund elective abortions through various programs. The executive order revokes two specific orders from the Biden administration that expanded access to reproductive healthcare, including abortion services, following the overturn of Roe v. Wade.

The order directs the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to provide guidance to federal departments and agencies to ensure the implementation of this policy. It emphasizes that the order should not interfere with the legal authority of any executive department or agency or the budgetary functions of the Office of Management and Budget.

Overall, this executive order reflects a shift in federal policy back to the principles of the Hyde Amendment, emphasizing that federal taxpayer dollars should not be used to fund or promote elective abortions. This move aligns with the administration's broader anti-abortion stance and revokes previous efforts to expand reproductive rights and healthcare access.

## Memorandum for the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Administrator of the United States for International Development (Presidential Actions, January 24, 2025)

The memorandum issued on January 24, 2025, by the President revokes a previous policy from January 28, 2021, and reinstates the Mexico City Policy from January 23, 2017. This policy affects how U.S. federal funds are used by foreign non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in relation to abortion services. Specifically, it blocks U.S. funding for NGOs that provide abortion counseling, referrals, or services, or advocate for the liberalization of abortion laws. The policy is often referred to as the "global gag rule" because it restricts what organizations can say or do regarding abortion, even with their own non-U.S. funds.

The memorandum directs the Secretary of State, in coordination with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, to implement a plan extending the policy's requirements to all global health assistance provided by U.S. departments or agencies. It also instructs the Secretary of State to ensure that U.S. taxpayer dollars do not fund organizations involved in coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization.

The Mexico City Policy has been a point of contention, with Republican administrations typically reinstating it and Democratic administrations rescinding it. Critics argue that the policy reduces access to family planning services, leading to increased unintended pregnancies and abortions, while supporters claim it prevents U.S. funds from supporting abortion-related activities. The policy's reinstatement in 2025 marks another shift in the ongoing debate over U.S. foreign aid and reproductive health services.

## The National Day of Remembrance of the 80th Anniversary of the Liberation of Auschwitz, 2025 (Presidential Actions, January 27, 2025)

Today is the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau, a Nazi concentration camp in Poland where over a million Jews and other victims were killed during the Holocaust. This day is a time for America and the world to remember those who suffered and died, and to honor the survivors and those who fought for freedom. The Holocaust left a deep impact on families, with many losing loved ones to the horrors of anti-Semitism.

Despite the lessons learned from the Holocaust, anti-Semitism still exists in some parts of the world. On this day, there is a renewed commitment to fight against such hatred and to ensure it has no place in society. The Jewish people have shown resilience by establishing the modern State of Israel, and they continue to symbolize human strength and victory.

The President of the United States, Donald J. Trump, has proclaimed January 27, 2025, as a National Day of Remembrance. He encourages all Americans to participate in activities that honor the victims of the Holocaust and recognize the sacrifices made by those who helped liberate Auschwitz. This proclamation serves as a reminder of the importance of dignity and respect for all people.

## The Iron Dome for America (Presidential Actions, January 27, 2025)

The executive order titled "The Iron Dome for America," issued on January 27, 2025, by the President of the United States, aims to address the growing threat of advanced missile attacks on the country. The order highlights the need for a next-generation missile defense shield to protect against ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missiles, among other aerial threats. This initiative is reminiscent of President Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, which was never fully realized. The new policy emphasizes the importance of maintaining a secure second-strike capability and ensuring the defense of the nation and its citizens through advanced missile defense systems.

The order outlines a detailed implementation plan, requiring the Secretary of Defense to submit a comprehensive architecture and requirements for the missile defense shield within 60 days. This plan includes deploying space-based interceptors, enhancing tracking capabilities, and developing non-kinetic methods to counter missile threats. Additionally, the order calls for increased cooperation with allies to improve missile defense capabilities and protect forward-deployed troops. The initiative also stresses the importance of a secure supply chain and the development of technologies to intercept missiles before they are launched.

It aims to enhance national security by deploying a robust and technologically advanced missile defense system, while also fostering international collaboration to address shared security challenges. The order acknowledges the complexity and cost of such a defense system but underscores its necessity in maintaining peace and stability in the face of modern strategic threats.

## Prioritizing Military Excellence and Readiness (Presidential Actions, January 27, 2025)

The executive order issued on January 27, 2025, by the President of the United States focuses on maintaining military excellence and readiness. It emphasizes that the military's primary mission is to protect the nation and its people, requiring a strong focus on developing a warrior ethos. The order argues that accommodating political agendas or ideologies, such as radical gender ideology, can harm unit cohesion and military effectiveness. It states that individuals expressing a gender identity different from their biological sex do not meet the rigorous standards necessary for military service, as it conflicts with the values of honesty, humility, and selflessness expected from service members.

The order outlines a policy that sets high standards for troop readiness, cohesion, and integrity, which it claims are inconsistent with the medical and mental health needs of individuals with gender dysphoria. It also opposes the use of pronouns that do not align with an individual's biological sex. The Secretary of Defense is tasked with updating military medical standards and ending the use of identification-based pronouns. Additionally, the order revokes a previous executive order that allowed transgender individuals to serve openly in the military, requiring all related policies to be rescinded.

The implementation of this order involves updating military policies within 60 days and ensuring compliance across all military departments. It also includes specific provisions regarding the use of facilities designated for males and females. Overall, the order seeks to prioritize military readiness and cohesion by enforcing strict standards related to gender identity and medical fitness.

## Reinstating Service Members Discharged Under the Military’s COVID-19 Vaccination Mandate (Presidential Actions, January 27, 2025)

The executive order signed on January 27, 2025, by President Donald Trump aims to reinstate military service members who were discharged for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine. The order acknowledges that the vaccine mandate, initially imposed by the Secretary of Defense in August 2021 and later rescinded in January 2023, was an unfair burden on service members. It highlights that many were unjustly discharged without receiving exemptions they were entitled to. The order mandates the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security to facilitate the reinstatement of these service members, allowing them to return to their previous rank and receive full back pay and benefits.

The order outlines specific actions to be taken, such as making reinstatement available to those discharged solely for vaccine refusal and allowing those who voluntarily left to avoid the vaccine to return without affecting their service status. It also emphasizes that disciplinary actions for other conduct violations remain unaffected. The order requires a progress report within 60 days and includes provisions for severability and general implementation guidelines.

Overall, the executive order seeks to address what is perceived as an injustice against service members who were discharged due to the vaccine mandate. It provides a pathway for their return to service with compensation for lost pay and benefits, while maintaining the integrity of military discipline and administrative processes.

## Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation (Presidential Actions, January 28, 2025)

On January 28, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order aimed at stopping what is described as "chemical and surgical mutilation" of children, referring to gender-affirming medical procedures for minors. The order states that the U.S. government will not support or fund any medical interventions that attempt to change a child's sex, such as puberty blockers, hormone treatments, or surgeries. It criticizes the guidance from the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) and calls for a review of best practices for treating children with gender dysphoria.

The executive order directs various federal agencies to take actions to restrict access to gender-affirming care. This includes rescinding policies based on WPATH guidance, defunding institutions that provide such care, and excluding these procedures from federal health insurance programs like TRICARE and the Federal Employee Health Benefits program. The Department of Justice is also instructed to prioritize enforcement against practices it deems harmful and to support legislation allowing legal action against medical professionals involved in these procedures.

The order has sparked significant controversy and legal challenges. Several states and organizations, including the ACLU and Lambda Legal, have filed lawsuits arguing that the order is unconstitutional and discriminatory. They claim it violates the rights of transgender individuals and interferes with medical practices. Some state attorneys general have opposed the order, emphasizing their commitment to protecting access to gender-affirming care, while others have instructed compliance to avoid legal risks.

## Expanding Educational Freedom and Opportunity for Families (Presidential Actions, January 29, 2025)

The executive order issued on January 29, 2025, aims to expand educational freedom and opportunities for families in the United States. It acknowledges that many children are not thriving in their assigned public schools, as evidenced by low proficiency levels in reading and math among 8th graders. The order highlights the financial strain on families due to the high cost of housing in districts with preferred schools. To address these issues, the order supports educational choice, allowing families to select the best educational settings for their children, which can lead to improved student achievement and better performance of nearby public schools.

The order outlines several actions to promote educational choice. It directs the Secretary of Education to provide guidance on using federal funds to support K-12 educational choice initiatives. It also emphasizes the inclusion of education freedom as a priority in discretionary grant programs. Additionally, the order calls for plans to expand educational opportunities for low-income families, military families, and children eligible for Bureau of Indian Education schools. These plans involve using federal funds to support educational alternatives, including private and faith-based options.

Overall, the executive order seeks to empower parents in choosing the best educational paths for their children, thereby fostering competition and improvement in the education system. It aims to provide more options for families, particularly those in low-income and military communities, by leveraging federal funds to support diverse educational choices.

## Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling (Presidential Actions, January 29, 2025)

The executive order issued on January 29, 2025, by President Trump aims to address what he perceives as "radical indoctrination" in K-12 schools. The order claims that schools have been teaching anti-American ideologies and blocking parental oversight, which undermines critical thinking and family unity. It emphasizes the need to protect parental rights and eliminate discriminatory programs, particularly those related to gender identity and diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. The order defines "discriminatory equity ideology" as treating individuals based on group identity rather than individual merit and capability, and it seeks to promote a more positive vision of American history through "patriotic education."

The order directs federal agencies, including the Departments of Education, Defense, and Health and Human Services, to develop a strategy to eliminate federal funding for schools that engage in what the administration considers illegal and discriminatory indoctrination. This includes activities related to gender ideology and discriminatory equity ideology. The order also reestablishes the President’s Advisory 1776 Commission to promote patriotic education and support initiatives related to American history and civics education. The commission will work to develop programs and awards that recognize student knowledge of America's founding principles and history.

While the order does not immediately cut funding to schools, it sets in motion a process for identifying and potentially rescinding federal funds from schools that violate the order's principles. The order has sparked debate and tension between federal directives and state laws, particularly concerning issues of gender identity and diversity. Legal challenges are anticipated as the order attempts to impose conditions on federal funding, and schools are encouraged to review their policies and consult legal counsel to navigate the evolving legal landscape.

## Celebrating America’s 250th Birthday (Presidential Actions, January 29, 2025)

The executive order issued by the President on January 29, 2025, outlines plans for a grand celebration of America's 250th Independence Day on July 4, 2026. To organize this event, the order establishes the White House Task Force on Celebrating America’s 250th Birthday, known as Task Force 250. This task force will be chaired by the President, with the Vice President serving as Vice Chair. It includes various high-ranking officials from different government departments and agencies. The task force is responsible for planning and coordinating the celebrations and will work closely with other agencies to ensure a successful event. All agencies involved are required to submit their plans and activities related to the celebration by March 1, 2025.

Additionally, the executive order reinstates previous orders related to the National Garden of American Heroes, aiming to expand the number of historically significant Americans honored in the garden to 250.

The task force will be housed under the Department of Defense, which will provide funding and administrative support. The order emphasizes the importance of honoring American history and ensuring the protection of national monuments during this significant anniversary.

## Expanding Migrant Operations Center at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay to Full Capacity (Presidential Actions, January 29, 2025)

The memorandum issued on January 29, 2025, directs the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security to expand the Migrant Operations Center at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay to its full capacity. This expansion aims to provide more detention space for high-priority criminal aliens who are unlawfully present in the United States. The memorandum also addresses immigration enforcement needs identified by the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security.

The purpose of this directive is to stop what is described as a border invasion, dismantle criminal cartels, and restore national sovereignty. However, the memorandum explicitly states that it does not create any legal rights or benefits that can be enforced against the United States or its entities by any party.

This action has sparked controversy, with organizations like the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP) criticizing the plan. They argue that expanding the detention center could lead to inhumane conditions and mass detention without proper oversight. Critics emphasize the need for humane treatment and legal rights for detainees, urging the closure of the facility instead of its expansion.

## President Donald J. Trump Signed S.5 into Law (Presidential Actions, January 29, 2025)

President Donald Trump signed the Laken Riley Act into law on January 29, 2025. This law requires the detention of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. who are accused of crimes such as theft, even if they have not been convicted. The Act is named after Laken Riley, a Georgia nursing student who was killed by an undocumented immigrant. The law aims to prevent similar incidents by mandating the detention of immigrants accused of certain crimes and allowing states to sue the federal government if it fails to enforce these provisions.

The Laken Riley Act has sparked controversy and debate. Supporters argue that it strengthens border security and holds immigrants accountable for crimes. However, critics, including many Democrats, express concerns about the erosion of due process rights and the potential for unjust detentions. They also highlight the lack of funding for implementing the law, estimating it could cost $83 billion over three years. Despite these concerns, the bill received bipartisan support, with some Democrats backing it due to constituent demands for stricter immigration enforcement.

The Act also grants state attorneys general the power to sue the federal government for not enforcing immigration laws effectively. Additionally, it prohibits issuing visas to citizens of countries that refuse to accept deported nationals. While the Act aims to enhance immigration enforcement, it has raised significant concerns about civil rights and the financial burden on federal authorities.

## Additional Measures to Combat Anti-Semitism (Presidential Actions, January 29, 2025)

President Trump issued an Executive Order on January 29, 2025, to combat anti-Semitism, especially in educational institutions. This order builds on a previous order from 2019, which aimed to protect Jewish students from discrimination. The new order was prompted by a rise in anti-Semitic incidents following terrorist attacks in Israel in October 2023. It mandates that federal agencies identify and report on legal tools and actions to address anti-Semitism, focusing on civil rights violations in schools and universities.

The order requires each federal agency to submit a report within 60 days, detailing actions and authorities that can be used to fight anti-Semitism. The Attorney General and Secretary of Education must include analyses of court cases and Title VI complaints related to anti-Semitism in their reports. The order also encourages the use of civil rights enforcement laws to address harassment and violence. Additionally, it calls for recommendations on monitoring and reporting activities by international students and staff that may violate U.S. laws.

Overall, the Executive Order emphasizes a strong federal response to anti-Semitism, using legal measures to hold perpetrators accountable and protect Jewish students. It aims to ensure that educational institutions are aware of and comply with laws related to anti-Semitism, and it seeks to prevent discrimination and violence against Jewish individuals in the United States.

## Immediate Assessment of Aviation Safety (Presidential Actions, January 30, 2025)

On January 29, 2025, a tragic collision occurred between a commercial aircraft and a military helicopter near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, resulting in the loss of lives. This incident has prompted President Trump to issue a memorandum directing an immediate assessment of aviation safety. The President criticized past administrations, particularly the Obama and Biden administrations, for implementing hiring practices at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that he claims prioritized diversity over merit and competence. He argues that these practices have compromised safety standards and calls for a return to merit-based recruitment and promotion within the FAA.

In response to the accident, President Trump has ordered the Secretary of Transportation and the FAA Administrator to review all hiring decisions and safety protocol changes made in the past four years. The goal is to ensure aviation safety by taking corrective actions, including replacing individuals who do not meet qualification standards. This review aims to address any decline in hiring and safety standards that may have occurred during the Biden administration. The President emphasizes the importance of prioritizing safety and competence to restore public confidence in aviation safety.

The memorandum aligns with a previous Presidential Memorandum titled "Keeping Americans Safe in Aviation," issued on January 21, 2025. It underscores the administration's commitment to reversing concerning trends in safety and personnel practices over the past four years. The directive aims to instill a strong commitment to aviation safety, ensuring that all Americans can fly with peace of mind.

## Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation (Presidential Actions, January 31, 2025)

President Trump's executive order, titled "Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation," aims to reduce the number of federal regulations to promote economic growth and innovation. The order requires that for every new regulation introduced, at least ten existing regulations must be repealed. This "10 for 1" rule is more aggressive than the previous "2 for 1" rule from Trump's first administration. The goal is to ensure that the total cost of new regulations is significantly less than zero, meaning that the overall regulatory burden should decrease.

The executive order also mandates that starting in fiscal year 2026, each federal agency must report the total costs or savings associated with new and repealed regulations. These reports will be part of the Unified Regulatory Agenda, which requires approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) before any regulation can be added or removed. The OMB will set a regulatory budget for each agency, dictating the permissible regulatory costs for each fiscal year.

Certain regulations are exempt from this order, including those related to national security, foreign affairs, and agency management. The order also revokes the 2023 update to OMB Circular A-4, reinstating the 2003 version, which changes how regulatory costs and benefits are analyzed. This move is intended to focus on the overall economic costs and benefits of regulations, rather than broader considerations like global impacts or distributional effects.

## Limiting Lame-Duck Collective Bargaining Agreements That Improperly Attempt to Constrain the New President (Presidential Actions, January 31, 2025)

The memorandum issued on January 31, 2025, by the President aims to limit the approval of collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) made in the last 30 days before a new President takes office. These agreements, often finalized by the outgoing administration, can impose policies that the new administration may find inefficient or contrary to its goals. For instance, a CBA negotiated by the Department of Education just before the new President took office restricted the return of remote employees to their offices. Such agreements are seen as attempts to bind the new President to the predecessor's policies, which contradicts the democratic principle that each administration should have the freedom to implement its policies.

The memorandum sets clear standards for CBAs during this transition period. It prohibits any new contractual obligations, substantive changes to existing agreements, or extensions of current agreements within the 30 days before a new administration begins. If any such agreements are made, they must be disapproved by the agency heads unless they primarily cover law enforcement officers. This policy ensures that the new President retains the authority to manage the executive branch without being constrained by last-minute agreements from the previous administration.

Additionally, the memorandum clarifies that it does not affect the legal authority of executive departments or the functions of the Office of Management and Budget.
