## ICC Prosecutor Seeks Arrest Warrants for Darfur Atrocities

The International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor, Karim Khan, has announced plans to seek arrest
warrants for individuals accused of committing atrocities in Sudan's West Darfur region. This
announcement was made during a briefing to the United Nations Security Council. The region has been
embroiled in conflict since mid-April 2023, with ethnic cleansing reported by paramilitary forces
fighting against government forces.

Khan emphasized that crimes are being committed daily in Darfur, using violence as a weapon of war.
The ICC's investigation is based on a thorough analysis of evidence and information collected by the
prosecutor's office. The conflict in Darfur echoes the genocide and war crimes committed two decades
ago by the Janjaweed militias, which resulted in the deaths of up to 300,000 people and the
displacement of 2.7 million.

The ICC is particularly concerned about allegations of gender-based crimes against women and girls,
which are a priority for the court. The prosecutor has urged compliance with international
humanitarian law and has engaged with the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) to gather information relevant
to the investigations.

The situation in Darfur has led to significant humanitarian suffering, with thousands displaced and
vital infrastructure destroyed. The ICC's actions aim to bring justice and accountability to the
region, addressing the ongoing cycle of violence and despair.

## Scientists Find Super-Earth Exoplanet in Habitable Zone

Scientists have discovered a new super-Earth exoplanet, HD 20794 d, located 19.7 light-years away in
the habitable zone of its star, a G-type star similar to our Sun. This exoplanet is part of a
planetary system with two other planets and follows an eccentric orbit, oscillating in and out of
the habitable zone where liquid water could potentially exist. The discovery was made by an
international team, including members from the University of Geneva, after analyzing over 20 years
of observational data using advanced telescopes and data reduction algorithms.

## Chinese Scientists Create Mice with Two Male Parents

Chinese scientists have successfully created mice with two male parents using genetic engineering
techniques. This breakthrough was achieved by a team led by Wei Li at the Chinese Academy of
Sciences in Beijing, and the findings were published in the journal _Cell Stem Cell_ on January
28, 2025.

### Key Points

- **Gene Editing Techniques**: The researchers used embryonic stem cell engineering to target and
  modify imprinting genes, which are crucial in regulating gene expression. These genes have been a
  significant barrier to unisexual reproduction in mammals.
- **Previous Challenges**: Earlier attempts to create bi-paternal mice faced developmental halts due
  to imprinting abnormalities. The new approach involved modifying 20 key imprinting genes using
  techniques like frameshift mutations and gene deletions.
- **Outcomes**: The study resulted in the creation of bi-paternal mice that sometimes lived to
  adulthood. However, only 11.8% of the embryos developed to birth, and many of the mice that
  reached adulthood had developmental defects, altered growth, and a shortened lifespan. They were
  also sterile.
- **Implications for Regenerative Medicine**: The research provides insights into overcoming
  barriers in stem cell and regenerative medicine. It highlights the potential for improving
  developmental outcomes in embryonic stem cells and cloned animals.
- **Future Research**: The team plans to continue studying imprinting gene modifications to enhance
  developmental potential and aims to extend their methods to larger animals like monkeys. However,
  ethical guidelines currently prohibit similar experiments in humans due to safety concerns.

### Ethical Considerations

The International Society for Stem Cell Research's guidelines do not allow heritable genome editing
for reproductive purposes in humans, nor the use of human stem cell-derived gametes for
reproduction, as these are considered unsafe at present.

### Conclusion

This research marks a significant step in reproductive biology and stem cell medicine, demonstrating
the potential to overcome genetic barriers to unisexual reproduction in mammals. However, there are
still many challenges and ethical considerations to address before such techniques can be applied to
humans or other larger animals.

## Trump Freezes Federal Grants

### **1. Implementation of the Freeze**

The Trump administration issued a memo on January 28, 2025, through the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB), ordering a temporary pause on federal grants and loans to review their alignment with
President Trump’s executive orders targeting "Marxist equity, transgenderism, Green New Deal
policies," and diversity initiatives. The freeze, initially set to take effect at 5 p.m. ET that
day, aimed to halt trillions in federal financial assistance, excluding direct payments like Social
Security, Medicare, and food stamps. However, a federal judge, Loren L. AliKhan, blocked the freeze
hours before implementation, issuing an administrative stay until February 3.

### **2. Scope and Immediate Impacts**

The vague wording of the OMB memo caused widespread confusion. Programs at risk included:

- **Domestic aid**: Grants for education (e.g., Head Start), infrastructure (e.g., water systems in
  Alabama), public health research, and nonprofits like Meals on Wheels.
- **Foreign aid**: A separate 90-day freeze disrupted medical supplies (e.g., HIV and malaria drugs)
  to countries reliant on U.S. assistance.
- **State-level chaos**: Medicaid portals crashed in all 50 states, delaying reimbursements, though
  the White House claimed payments were unaffected.

### **3. Legal Challenges**

Multiple lawsuits were filed, arguing the freeze violated the **Impoundment Control Act** (which
requires congressional approval to withhold funds) and the **Administrative Procedure Act** (for
being "arbitrary and capricious"). Plaintiffs included nonprofits, health organizations, and 23
Democratic state attorneys general. Legal experts warned the Supreme Court might ultimately decide
the case, given Trump’s claim that the Impoundment Control Act is unconstitutional.

### **4. Political and Public Reactions**

- **Democrats**: Condemned the move as "unlawful," "reckless," and a threat to public services.
  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called it "Project 2025 by another name," referencing Trump’s
  broader agenda to reshape federal spending.
- **Republicans**: While some (e.g., Rep. Don Bacon) expressed concern over disruptions to
  constituents, others defended the freeze as part of Trump’s mandate to realign federal priorities
  .
- **Nonprofits and States**: Organizations like the National Council of Nonprofits warned of
  "devastating" impacts, including halted cancer research and closed homeless shelters.

### **5. Administration’s Defense**

The White House framed the freeze as a necessary step to eliminate "woke" policies and ensure
taxpayer dollars align with Trump’s priorities. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt emphasized
exemptions for direct individual aid and claimed the pause was temporary. OMB Acting Director
Matthew Vaeth argued the review would root out "social engineering" policies.

### **6. Broader Implications**

The freeze underscores Trump’s aggressive use of executive power to bypass Congress, testing
constitutional boundaries over spending authority. It has also intensified debates about the role of
federal grants in supporting critical services and the potential for long-term disruptions if the
pause extends.

## Rwanda-Backed Rebels Claim Control of Goma in Eastern Congo

Rwanda-backed M23 rebels have claimed control over Goma, a key city in eastern Congo, escalating
tensions in the region. The capture was announced just before a deadline for the Congolese army to
surrender expired. This development has caused mass panic among Goma's 2 million residents, with
many fleeing the city amid ongoing violence.

The M23 rebels, who have been gaining territory along the Congo-Rwanda border, issued an ultimatum
to the Congolese forces to surrender or face an attack. The situation has led to a humanitarian
crisis, with over a third of North Kivu's population already displaced. The United Nations has
reported that peacekeepers are processing surrendering Congolese soldiers, and the city is
experiencing significant disruptions, including the closure of its airport.

Congo's government has accused Rwanda of backing the M23 rebels, a claim Rwanda denies despite
evidence from U.N. experts. The conflict has historical roots, with M23 emerging from earlier
Tutsi-led militias. The situation has prompted Congo to sever diplomatic ties with Rwanda, and
international calls for a ceasefire have intensified.

The ongoing conflict has resulted in casualties, including U.N. peacekeepers, and has further
destabilized the region, which is already one of the world's largest humanitarian crises. The U.N.
and other countries have condemned the rebel actions and called for an immediate withdrawal.

## Scientists Create Endometriosis in Lab

For the first time, scientists have successfully recreated endosymbiosis in a laboratory setting, a
process where one microbe lives permanently inside another. This breakthrough was achieved by
researchers at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, led by Julia Vorholt and Gabriel
Giger. They managed to induce endosymbiosis by injecting bacteria into a fungus, overcoming
significant technical challenges to ensure the survival and cooperation of both organisms.

### Key Points

- **Endosymbiosis Background**: Endosymbiosis is a crucial evolutionary process where one organism
  lives inside another, leading to complex life forms. Mitochondria and chloroplasts in eukaryotic
  cells are classic examples of endosymbiotic relationships.
- **Experimental Approach**: The researchers used a strain of the fungus _Rhizopus microsporus_ and
  the bacterium _Mycetohabitans rhizoxinica_, which naturally form an endosymbiotic relationship.
  They injected the bacteria into a strain of the fungus that does not naturally contain the
  bacteria, using a combination of enzymes and a modified atomic force microscope to penetrate the
  fungal cell wall.
- **Technical Innovations**: A significant challenge was physically introducing the bacteria into
  the fungus. The team used a bicycle pump to increase pressure and successfully inject the bacteria
  into the fungal cells, a novel approach that represents a technological advancement in the field.
- **Observations and Results**: Once inside, the bacteria reproduced at a rate that did not trigger
  the fungal immune response, allowing both organisms to survive and adapt to each other. Over
  successive generations, the bacteria integrated into the fungal spores, demonstrating a stable
  endosymbiotic relationship.
- **Implications**: This experiment provides insights into the initial stages of endosymbiosis and
  how such relationships can stabilize quickly. It opens up possibilities for synthetic biology,
  where engineered endosymbiotic relationships could be used for various applications, such as
  bioremediation or drug production.

This successful recreation of endosymbiosis in the lab not only sheds light on a fundamental
evolutionary process but also paves the way for future research and applications in synthetic
biology.

## Trump Offers Buyouts to Federal Workers Who Do Not Return to In-Person Work

The Trump administration is set to issue a memo offering buyouts to federal workers who do not wish
to return to in-person office work. This initiative is part of a broader directive requiring federal
employees to resume full-time, in-person work following the pandemic's remote work arrangements.

Key points include:

- Federal workers opting for the buyout must resign by February 6 and will receive severance pay
  through September 30.
- The heads of federal agencies were informed about this plan shortly before its announcement.
- This move aligns with the administration's broader efforts to reduce remote work and bring federal
  operations back to pre-pandemic norms.

The buyout offer is part of a series of actions by the Trump administration to reshape federal
workforce policies, including pausing federal grants and loans and restructuring diversity, equity,
and inclusion programs.

## Trump Orders Development of Iron Dome Missile Defense System

President Donald Trump signed an executive order titled "The Iron Dome for America," which mandates
the development of a next-generation missile defense system for the United States. This initiative
is inspired by Israel's Iron Dome but aims to address the unique challenges posed by the vast size
and diverse threats faced by the U.S.

### Key Points of the Executive Order

- **Objective**: The order seeks to create a multilayered homeland air defense system capable of
  defending against ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation
  aerial threats from various adversaries.
- **Space-Based Interceptors**: A significant aspect of the order is the development of space-based
  interceptors, which are intended to provide global coverage and early intercept capabilities. This
  approach is controversial due to concerns about potentially triggering an arms race and affecting
  existing treaties.
- **Implementation Timeline**: The Secretary of Defense is given 60 days to submit a detailed plan,
  including a reference architecture and capabilities-based requirements for the defense system.
- **Budget Considerations**: Although the order does not specify budgetary estimates, it suggests
  that the fiscal 2026 budget should reflect the requirements of this initiative.
- **Industrial and Technological Emphasis**: The order emphasizes securing the defense industrial
  base and integrating next-generation security features into the supply chain to support the
  development of advanced interceptors and tracking systems.

### Challenges and Criticisms

- **Feasibility Concerns**: Experts have raised doubts about the feasibility of implementing an Iron
  Dome-style system in the U.S. due to its large size compared to Israel. The technical and
  financial challenges of such a system are significant.
- **Comparison with Israel's System**: While Israel's Iron Dome is effective for its smaller
  territory, the U.S. system would need to cover a much larger area and defend against more
  sophisticated threats, requiring a different scale and capability.

Overall, the executive order sets a bold agenda for enhancing the U.S.'s missile defense
capabilities, drawing inspiration from Israel's Iron Dome but adapting it to meet the unique needs
and challenges of the United States.

## Trump Orders Federal Restrictions on Gender Transition for Minors

On January 28, 2025, President Donald Trump signed an executive order titled "Protecting Children
from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation." This order aims to restrict access to gender transition
procedures for individuals under the age of 19. Here are the key points of the executive order:

- **Federal Program Restrictions**: The order seeks to prevent federal programs from funding,
  sponsoring, promoting, assisting, or supporting gender transitions for individuals under 19 years
  of age. This includes federal insurance programs like Tricare and Medicaid, which are directed to
  exclude coverage for gender transitions for this age group.
- **Definition of Procedures**: The order defines "chemical and surgical mutilation" to include
  puberty blockers, hormones like estrogen and testosterone, and surgical procedures related to
  gender transition.
- **Enforcement of Existing Laws**: Trump emphasized that the U.S. will rigorously enforce all laws
  that prohibit or limit these procedures, which he describes as destructive and life-altering.
- **Review of Best Practices**: The order instructs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to
  publish a review of existing literature on best practices for promoting the health of children
  experiencing gender dysphoria or identity-based confusion.
- **Context and Background**: This executive order is part of a broader agenda by Trump to roll back
  protections for the transgender community. It follows other actions, such as a ban on transgender
  individuals serving in the military and an executive order recognizing only two sexes, male and
  female, assigned at birth.

This executive order has sparked significant controversy and legal challenges, as it aligns with a
series of state laws that limit access to gender-affirming care and has been criticized for
promoting sex discrimination.

## Syria Discovers More Mass Graves

The recent discovery of mass graves in Syria has unveiled a grim legacy of the Assad regime's
brutality. Syrian civil defense workers, known as the White Helmets, found the charred remains of at
least 26 victims in two basements in rural Damascus. These remains, believed to include men, women,
and children, showed signs of gunshot wounds and burning. This discovery adds to the growing number
of mass graves found since the fall of the Assad government in December 2024.

The White Helmets have uncovered over 780 bodies, many of unknown identity, since November 2024.
These bodies are often found in shallow graves, sometimes uncovered by locals or animals. The
remains are transferred to forensic experts to determine their identities and causes of death, a
process that could take years.

Residents in the area have reported the overwhelming stench of decomposing bodies, which they
initially did not report due to fear of government reprisals. The Assad regime, which ruled Syria
for over two decades, used airstrikes, torture, executions, and mass imprisonment to maintain
control during the country's civil war.

The United Nations Syria Commission of Inquiry has highlighted that mass graves could provide
evidence to uncover the fates of thousands of missing detainees. The commission's report, based on
14 years of investigations, documents the brutal methods of torture used by the former government.
For many Syrians, these findings may offer the best hope of uncovering the truth about missing
relatives.
