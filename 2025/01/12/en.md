## Antarctic Ice Core Retrieval

An international team of scientists has successfully drilled a 1.2 million-year-old ice core from Antarctica, reaching nearly two miles deep into the bedrock. This effort, part of the Beyond EPICA project funded by the European Union, involved scientists from ten countries and took place at Little Dome C near the Concordia Research Station. The project aims to provide insights into Earth's atmospheric and climate evolution, particularly focusing on changes in greenhouse gases and climate conditions over time.

The ice core is expected to offer a continuous climate record, helping scientists understand the interlink between the carbon cycle and Earth's temperature. This record could shed light on the Mid-Pleistocene Transition, a period when Earth's glacial cycles shifted from occurring every 40,000 years to every 100,000 years. The analysis of this ancient ice could also help explain why humans survived massive climate shifts during the Pleistocene.

The drilling was conducted over four years in extreme conditions, with temperatures averaging minus-25.6Â°F. The ice core will be transported to Europe for further analysis, where scientists hope to uncover even older climate records. This research is crucial for understanding past climate shifts and the long-term impacts of human activities on the environment.
