## New Human-Like Species Proposed for Chinese Fossils

A recent discovery of ancient fossils in China has led scientists to propose the existence of a new human-like species, named Homo juluensis. This proposal is based on the analysis of skull fragments, teeth, and other remains found at various sites in China, which date back to between 300,000 and 100,000 years ago. The most notable feature of this proposed species is its large brain size, which exceeds that of modern humans, Homo sapiens.

The fossils, which include 21 specimens found in the 1970s at the Xujiayao site, have puzzled scientists for decades due to their unique characteristics that do not fit neatly into the existing human family tree. Researchers Christopher Bae and Wu Xiujie have suggested that these fossils represent a distinct species, Homo juluensis, named for its large cranial capacity. The term juluensis is derived from "ju lu", which means "huge head" in Chinese.

This proposal has sparked debate among paleoanthropologists. Some experts argue that it is premature to classify these fossils as a new species without more comprehensive evidence, particularly genetic data. The controversy is further fueled by comparisons to the Denisovans, an ancient human population known primarily from DNA evidence rather than fossil records.

Additionally, there is ongoing discussion about the relationship between these fossils and the so-called "Dragon Man," a fossilized skull found in Harbin, China, which some researchers believe may belong to the Denisovan lineage. The debate highlights the complexity of human evolution and the challenges in classifying ancient hominin species based on limited fossil evidence.

## Tech Stocks Slump on China's AI Progress

The recent panic in the stock market, particularly affecting the "Magnificent 7" tech stocks, is largely attributed to the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI model that has challenged the dominance of US tech giants. This has led to a significant sell-off in technology stocks, with Nvidia experiencing a record-breaking decline, wiping out nearly $600 billion in market value.

### Key Points

- **DeepSeek's Impact**: DeepSeek's AI model, known as R1, has gained significant attention for its efficiency and effectiveness, rivaling US counterparts like OpenAI and Meta. It has been ranked among the top five conversational agents by Berkeley, leading to concerns about the sustainability of the US tech giants' dominance in AI.
- **Market Reaction**: The introduction of DeepSeek has caused a reevaluation of the investment rationale for large-cap semiconductor companies, as it demonstrates that high-quality AI models can be developed with fewer resources. This has led to a broader sell-off in tech stocks, contributing to a potential $1 trillion rout. Nvidia's stock alone plummeted by 17%, marking the largest single-day market value loss in history.
- **Geopolitical and Economic Implications**: The rise of DeepSeek not only poses a technological challenge but also has geopolitical implications. If China continues to advance rapidly in AI, it could shift the balance of power in technology and economics, potentially impacting global markets and US tech companies' valuation.
- **Investor Sentiment**: Despite the panic, some analysts, like Dan Ives from Wedbush Securities, view this as a buying opportunity, suggesting that the sell-off might be an overreaction and that US tech companies still hold significant advantages in broader AI infrastructure.

Overall, the emergence of DeepSeek has sparked a significant reaction in the stock market, highlighting the competitive and geopolitical challenges facing US tech giants. The situation underscores the need for these companies to innovate and adapt to maintain their leadership in the AI space.

## GSK Collaborates with Oxford University on Cancer Research

GSK and the University of Oxford have announced a collaboration to establish the GSK-Oxford Cancer Immuno-Prevention Programme, with GSK investing up to £50 million over a minimum of three years. This partnership aims to explore the potential of cancer prevention through vaccination by conducting translational research into precancer biology. The goal is to generate insights into how cancer develops, which could inform new approaches to cancer vaccination.

The collaboration leverages the complementary expertise of GSK and Oxford in the fields of immunology, vaccinology, and cancer biology. Oxford's expertise in identifying and sequencing neoantigens—tumor-specific proteins that prompt the immune system to recognize cancer—will be crucial in this research. The programme aims to target the vulnerabilities of precancerous cells through vaccines or targeted medicines to prevent them from progressing to cancer.

This initiative builds on the existing relationship between GSK and Oxford, which includes the GSK-Oxford Institute of Molecular and Computational Medicine established in 2021. The partnership is seen as a significant step forward in cancer research, with the potential to unlock new methods of cancer prevention and bring hope to patients worldwide.

## Trump Administration Fires DOJ Officials

The Trump administration has recently fired more than a dozen Justice Department employees who were involved in criminal investigations of President Donald Trump. These employees were part of the team led by former special counsel Jack Smith, who was appointed to investigate Trump's handling of classified records and his conduct following the 2020 presidential election. Both cases were dismissed after Trump won the 2024 presidential election, as Justice Department policy prohibits the prosecution of a sitting president.

The decision to terminate these employees was made by Acting Attorney General James McHenry, who expressed concerns about their ability to implement Trump's agenda due to their significant roles in prosecuting the president. This move aligns with Trump's campaign promise to address what he described as the "weaponization of the federal government".

In addition to the firings, the Trump administration has launched a "special project" to investigate the prosecutors who handled cases related to the January 6 Capitol riot. This investigation is being led by interim U.S. Attorney Edward Martin, who has requested documents and information related to the use of obstruction charges against the rioters. The Supreme Court had previously ruled that these charges were too broadly applied.

These actions reflect a broader effort by the Trump administration to reshape the Justice Department by removing officials perceived as disloyal and reassigning senior career officials across divisions. The firings and reassignments have raised concerns about the potential politicization of the Justice Department and the impact on its independence.

## Trump Proposes Ceasefire for Ukraine Conflict

Donald Trump has proposed a ceasefire to end the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, but his plan faces skepticism and uncertainty from both Ukraine and Russia. Trump has promised to resolve the conflict quickly, initially claiming he could do so within 24 hours of taking office, but this has been met with harsh realities and skepticism.

### Key Points

- **Lack of Detailed Plan**: Trump's team has not yet presented a detailed blueprint for ending the war. His envoy to Ukraine aims for a peace deal within 100 days, but no concrete steps have been outlined.
- **Skepticism from Ukraine and Allies**: There is concern that Trump's administration might pressure Ukraine into making concessions without adequately pressuring Russia. This has raised alarms among Ukraine's allies and Western diplomats.
- **Challenges in Negotiations**: Experts doubt that Russian President Vladimir Putin would be willing to make concessions, especially as Russian forces continue to gain ground in eastern Ukraine. Trump's team acknowledges the difficulty of brokering a peace deal.
- **Security Guarantees**: Discussions around security guarantees for Ukraine are ongoing, but there is skepticism about their effectiveness. Past agreements, like the Budapest Memorandum, have failed to provide real security, and similar concerns persist today.
- **Diplomatic Efforts**: Trump's administration has not engaged in shuttle diplomacy between Kyiv, Moscow, and Mar-a-Lago. There have been no collaborative efforts with the Biden administration on Ukraine, unlike the Israel-Hamas ceasefire.
- **Potential Reduction in U.S. Aid**: Trump has suggested that U.S. military aid to Ukraine might be reduced, and he believes European countries should increase their support for Ukraine.

### Conclusion

Trump's proposal for a ceasefire in Ukraine faces significant challenges and skepticism. The lack of a detailed plan, combined with the complexities of international diplomacy and security guarantees, makes the prospect of a quick resolution uncertain. Both Ukraine and its allies remain cautious about the potential outcomes of Trump's approach.
