## Indonesia Joins BRICS

Indonesia's recent admission as the tenth full member of the BRICS bloc marks a significant development in the global economic landscape. Here's a detailed explanation of how and why Indonesia joined BRICS:

### Background of BRICS

- **BRICS** is an acronym for a group of major emerging economies: Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. The group was initially formed in 2009 to serve as a counterweight to the Group of Seven (G7), which consists of developed nations.
- The bloc aims to promote peace, security, and development in the global economy and to reform global governance institutions to be more inclusive of developing nations.

### Indonesia's Membership

- **Announcement and Endorsement**: Indonesia's candidacy for BRICS membership was endorsed by the BRICS leaders in August 2023. However, Indonesia chose to formalize its membership after the formation of its newly elected government.
- **Official Membership**: Indonesia officially became a full member of BRICS in January 2025. The announcement was made by Brazil, which holds the rotating presidency of the group for 2025.

### Reasons for Joining

- **Strategic Importance**: Indonesia, being the largest economy and most populous nation in Southeast Asia, shares a commitment with other BRICS members to reform global governance institutions and deepen South-South cooperation.
- **Economic Collaboration**: Indonesia views its membership as a strategic step to enhance collaboration with other developing countries, focusing on principles of equality, mutual respect, and sustainable development.
- **Global Role**: The membership reflects Indonesia's increasingly active role in global issues and its commitment to strengthening multilateral cooperation.

### Implications and Future Prospects

- **Economic Opportunities**: As a BRICS member, Indonesia can access funding from the New Development Bank and forge closer trade and investment ties with other BRICS economies.
- **Diplomatic Influence**: Indonesia's inclusion in BRICS is seen as a move to ensure that developing countries have a voice in global decision-making processes.
- **Commitment to BRICS Agenda**: Indonesia has vowed to contribute actively to the BRICS agenda, including promoting economic resilience and addressing food security.

In summary, Indonesia's entry into BRICS is a strategic move that aligns with its goals of enhancing economic collaboration and increasing its influence in global governance. The membership is expected to bring economic benefits and strengthen Indonesia's role in international affairs.
