## Australia's Mandatory Climate Reporting

Australia has implemented mandatory climate reporting for companies starting in January 2025. This initiative is part of a broader legislative effort to integrate climate-related risks and opportunities into business strategies and reporting frameworks. Here are the key points regarding this new requirement:

### Key Points

- **Legislation and Scope**: The mandatory climate reporting requirements were introduced through the Treasury Laws Amendment bill, which was passed by Australia's House of Representatives in September 2024. The legislation mandates large and medium-sized companies to disclose climate-related risks and opportunities, as well as greenhouse gas emissions across their value chains.
- **Implementation Timeline**: The reporting requirements will begin in January 2025 for the largest companies. These include public companies and large proprietary companies that meet specific size thresholds, such as having over 500 employees, revenues over $500 million, or assets over $1 billion. Medium-sized companies will start reporting in July 2026, and smaller companies will follow a year later.
- **Phased Approach**: The legislation includes a phased-in approach for Scope 3 emissions reporting, which covers indirect emissions in a company's value chain. Companies will have an additional year from the start of their disclosure requirements to report these emissions, along with a three-year protection from litigation concerning Scope 3 disclosures.
- **Alignment with Global Standards**: The climate-related reporting requirements are aligned with the standards set by the IFRS Foundationâ€™s International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB). The Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) is developing climate disclosure standards for Australian companies, expected to be issued soon, and the Australian Auditing and Assurance Board (AUASB) is working on assurance standards for these disclosures.
- **Net Zero Economy Authority**: Alongside the climate reporting legislation, a new Net Zero Economy Authority has been established to guide Australia's transition to a net zero emissions economy. This authority will focus on reskilling workers, coordinating with industry and investors, and supporting regions in attracting new clean energy industries.

### Summary

Australia's mandatory climate reporting is a significant step towards enhancing transparency and resilience in corporate operations by integrating climate-related risks into business strategies. The phased implementation allows companies to gradually adapt to the new requirements, while alignment with international standards ensures consistency and comparability in reporting. This initiative is part of Australia's broader commitment to achieving net zero emissions by 2050.

## Bulgaria and Romania Join Schengen Area

Bulgaria and Romania have completed the process of joining the Schengen Area, which allows for ID-check-free travel across member countries. This significant development means that land border controls between these two countries and other Schengen members will be lifted starting January 1, 2025.

### Key Points

- **Background**: Bulgaria and Romania joined the European Union in 2007. However, their full integration into the Schengen Area was delayed due to concerns about border security and irregular migration, particularly from Austria and other member states.
- **Partial Integration**: In March 2024, both countries were granted partial access to the Schengen Area, allowing free travel by air and sea. However, land border controls remained in place.
- **Recent Developments**: The decision to lift land border controls was made during a meeting of EU interior ministers under Hungary's presidency. Austria, which had previously blocked the decision, lifted its veto after observing significant improvements in border security and a decrease in irregular migration.
- **Economic and Social Impact**: The removal of land border controls is expected to have a positive economic impact, reducing logistical costs and wait times at borders. It will also facilitate faster travel for citizens and boost trade and tourism.
- **Security Measures**: Both Bulgaria and Romania have committed to strengthening their border security to manage migration effectively. This includes dismantling organized crime groups and increasing border patrols.
- **Significance**: This move is seen as a step towards greater European integration and cooperation in managing migration. It also reflects the EU's trust in Bulgaria and Romania's ability to handle border security.

Overall, the full integration of Bulgaria and Romania into the Schengen Area marks a significant milestone in their EU membership journey, enhancing mobility and economic opportunities while maintaining security standards.

## New Year's Day Attack in New Orleans

On New Year's Day in New Orleans, Louisiana, a tragic vehicle-ramming and shooting attack resulted in the deaths of 15 people, including the perpetrator, and injuries to 35 others. The attacker, identified as Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a 42-year-old Army veteran from Texas, drove a rented pickup truck into a crowd on Bourbon Street, a popular tourist area in the French Quarter. The attack was premeditated and is being investigated as an act of terrorism, with Jabbar reportedly inspired by ISIS.

Jabbar managed to bypass police barricades and drove onto the sidewalk, aiming to hit as many people as possible. After crashing the vehicle, he exited and opened fire on police officers with an assault rifle. The police returned fire, killing Jabbar at the scene. Two police officers were injured during the exchange.

The attack also involved potential explosive devices. Two functional improvised explosive devices (IEDs) were found in coolers near the scene and were safely neutralized by bomb technicians. Additional weapons and explosives were discovered in Jabbar's vehicle.

The incident has prompted a large-scale investigation involving the FBI, Homeland Security, and local law enforcement. Authorities are examining Jabbar's background, including his military service and potential connections to terror groups. Surveillance footage and social media posts by Jabbar indicated his intent and inspiration from ISIS.

The attack has drawn national attention, with President Biden and other officials condemning the violence and offering support to the victims and their families. The Sugar Bowl, a major college football event scheduled nearby, was postponed due to security concerns.
