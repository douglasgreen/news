### Moscow Faces Unprecedented Drone Attack Amidst US-Ukraine Peace Talks

In a dramatic escalation, Moscow was hit by the largest drone attack since the start of the conflict, just as crucial peace talks between the US and Ukraine were about to begin. The attack resulted in the deaths of at least two people and injured several others, including children. The drones caused significant disruptions, leading to temporary closures of Moscow's major airports and damage to residential buildings. Despite the chaos, Moscow's residents continued their daily routines, showcasing resilience in the face of adversity.

### Tulsi Gabbard Revokes Security Clearances Amid Political Tensions

In a significant move, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard announced the revocation of security clearances for several former Biden administration officials and the 51 intelligence officials who had signed a letter labeling the Hunter Biden laptop story as Russian disinformation. This decision, following an executive order from President Donald Trump, also includes barring former President Joe Biden from receiving the President’s Daily Brief. The action is part of a broader effort by Trump to address what he perceives as the misuse of intelligence community authority to influence political processes. Critics argue that this move could hinder the current administration's ability to consult with experienced former officials on global threats, while supporters see it as a necessary step to maintain the integrity of intelligence operations.

### Iconic D.C. Black Lives Matter Mural Removed Under Congressional Pressure

City workers in Washington, D.C. have begun removing the iconic "Black Lives Matter" street mural that has stood as a powerful symbol since 2020. The yellow uppercase letters, which spanned two city blocks on 16th Street near the White House, were painted during the nationwide protests following George Floyd's murder by Minneapolis police. Mayor Muriel Bowser, who originally declared the mural would be permanent in 2021, reluctantly ordered its removal after Republican congressman Andrew Clyde introduced legislation threatening to withhold federal funding unless the mural was removed and the area renamed Liberty Plaza. As jackhammers tore into the pavement on Monday, local residents gathered to witness the dismantling, with some collecting pieces of the pavement as mementos. "There's no such thing as erasure," said D.C. resident Adrianne Lind. "If that's the attempt, it's just not possible to do. It's not just that we saw it — the whole world saw it." The mayor indicated the area will undergo changes over the next six to eight weeks but has not provided specific details about what will replace the mural.

### Former Philippine President Duterte Arrested on ICC Warrant

Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was arrested at Manila's International Airport after returning from Hong Kong. The arrest was made under an International Criminal Court (ICC) warrant, which accuses him of crimes against humanity during his presidency from 2016 to 2022. Duterte's controversial "war on drugs" led to thousands of deaths, with allegations of extrajudicial killings. Human rights groups have long called for accountability, and his arrest is seen as a significant step towards justice. Despite the Philippines' withdrawal from the ICC in 2019, the court retains jurisdiction over crimes committed while the country was a member. Duterte, who has denied wrongdoing, questioned the legality of his arrest, but the current government has indicated willingness to cooperate with the ICC.

### Lost Ship Found: The Western Reserve Emerges from Lake Superior's Depths

After 132 years hidden beneath the waters of Lake Superior, the shipwreck of the Western Reserve has finally been discovered.

The ship was found by the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society using advanced sonar technology. The Western Reserve, once known for its speed and safety, broke apart in the storm, leaving only one survivor to tell the tale. The discovery of the shipwreck, lying 600 feet underwater and broken in two, brings closure to a long-standing maritime mystery and highlights the dangers of the Great Lakes, even for the most advanced ships of their time.

### Lakers Stumble Against Nets as Injuries Take Their Toll

The Los Angeles Lakers suffered a disappointing 111-108 loss to the Brooklyn Nets on Monday night, extending their losing streak to two games as they played without several key players. With LeBron James sidelined due to a strained left groin, along with Rui Hachimura, Jaxson Hayes, and Dorian Finney-Smith all out with injuries, the Lakers struggled on both ends of the court. Luka Dončić managed a triple-double with 22 points, 12 rebounds, and 12 assists, but shot poorly at 8-for-26, while Austin Reaves had an inefficient night going 3-for-14 from the field. Coach JJ Redick expressed frustration with the team's communication and effort, as the Lakers were outrebounded by the Nets and committed 16 turnovers that Brooklyn converted into 19 points. Despite bright spots from Gabe Vincent (24 points) and contributions from rookies Dalton Knecht and Jordan Goodwin, the shorthanded Lakers couldn't overcome their shooting woes and defensive lapses, dropping them to just a half-game lead over Memphis for third place in the Western Conference.
