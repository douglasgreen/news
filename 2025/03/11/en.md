### Iconic D.C. Black Lives Matter Mural Removed Under Congressional Pressure

City workers in Washington, D.C. have begun removing the iconic "Black Lives Matter" street mural that has stood as a powerful symbol since 2020. The yellow uppercase letters, which spanned two city blocks on 16th Street near the White House, were painted during the nationwide protests following George Floyd's murder by Minneapolis police. Mayor Muriel Bowser, who originally declared the mural would be permanent in 2021, reluctantly ordered its removal after Republican congressman Andrew Clyde introduced legislation threatening to withhold federal funding unless the mural was removed and the area renamed Liberty Plaza. As jackhammers tore into the pavement on Monday, local residents gathered to witness the dismantling, with some collecting pieces of the pavement as mementos. "There's no such thing as erasure," said D.C. resident Adrianne Lind. "If that's the attempt, it's just not possible to do. It's not just that we saw it — the whole world saw it." The mayor indicated the area will undergo changes over the next six to eight weeks but has not provided specific details about what will replace the mural.

### Former Philippine President Duterte Arrested on ICC Warrant

Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was arrested at Manila's International Airport after returning from Hong Kong.

### Freedom After 27 Years: Brittany Holberg's Conviction Overturned

Brittany Holberg, a Texas inmate who spent 27 years on death row, has had her conviction overturned by a federal appeals court. The court found that her right to a fair trial was violated because the prosecution failed to disclose that their key witness was a paid informant. Holberg was originally convicted of capital murder in 1998 for the death of an elderly man, claiming she acted in self-defense. The witness, who was her cellmate, later recanted her testimony, revealing that she was pressured to testify against Holberg. This new ruling highlights significant issues in the justice system, particularly regarding the use of informants and the importance of transparency in trials. Now, Holberg's case will return to the district court to determine the next steps, offering her a chance at a new trial and possibly freedom after nearly three decades.

### Saturn's Moon Family Grows with 128 New Members

Astronomers have made an exciting discovery by identifying 128 new moons orbiting Saturn, bringing the planet's total to an astonishing 274 moons. This discovery solidifies Saturn's position as the planet with the most moons in our solar system, surpassing Jupiter by a significant margin. The new moons were detected using a technique called "shift and stack," which involves combining multiple images to make faint moons visible. These moons are irregular in shape and are believed to be remnants of larger celestial bodies that broke apart due to collisions. The discovery not only highlights the dynamic nature of Saturn's moon system but also provides insights into the early solar system's turbulent history. As scientists continue to study these moons, they hope to learn more about the processes that shaped our cosmic neighborhood.

### Donating Blood: A Simple Act with Surprising Health Benefits

Donating blood is not only a generous act that can save lives, but it also offers unexpected health benefits for the donor. Recent studies have shown that regular blood donation may lead to healthier blood cells and even reduce the risk of developing pre-cancerous genetic changes. This is because the process of donating blood stimulates the body to produce new blood cells, which can improve overall blood health. Additionally, regular donors may experience lower iron levels, which is beneficial as high iron levels have been linked to certain health risks. While donating blood is generally safe, it's important for donors to be aware of potential temporary side effects like dizziness or lightheadedness. Overall, the act of giving blood not only helps those in need but also contributes positively to the donor's health.
