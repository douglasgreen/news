## Designating English as the Official Language of The United States (Presidential Actions, March 1, 2025)

On March 1, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order declaring English as the official language of the United States. This decision is rooted in the belief that a unified language strengthens national unity and facilitates the exchange of ideas among citizens. The order emphasizes that English has historically been the language of the nation's founding documents, such as the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. By designating English as the official language, the order aims to promote a cohesive society, streamline communication, and reinforce shared national values. It also encourages new Americans to learn English to better integrate into society and achieve economic success.

The executive order revokes a previous policy from 2000 that required federal agencies to provide language assistance to non-English speakers. However, it allows agencies to continue offering services in other languages if they choose. The order does not mandate changes to existing federal programs, making it largely symbolic. While more than 30 states have already made English their official language, this federal designation is seen as a victory for the English-only movement, which has been associated with efforts to limit bilingual education and immigration. Critics argue that the order contradicts the nation's tradition of embracing diversity and inclusivity.

## Immediate Expansion of American Timber Production (Presidential Actions, March 1, 2025)

The executive order issued by President Trump on March 1, 2025, aims to significantly increase the production of timber and related wood products in the United States. The order emphasizes the importance of timber production for construction, energy, and other essential activities. It highlights the need for better forest management and wildfire risk reduction to protect American lives and communities. The order criticizes existing federal policies that have limited the use of domestic timber resources, leading to reliance on foreign imports, job losses, and increased costs in construction and energy. The President calls for reversing these policies to enhance national and economic security.

To achieve these goals, the order directs the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture to issue new guidance to facilitate increased timber production and improve forest management. This includes reducing the time required to deliver timber and decreasing supply uncertainty. The order also mandates the development of a strategy to expedite the approval of forestry projects under the Endangered Species Act. Additionally, it requires setting targets for annual timber sales from federal lands and considering new categorical exclusions to streamline administrative processes related to timber production and forest management.

The order further instructs relevant agencies to eliminate delays in permitting processes and to revise or rescind regulations that burden timber production. It emphasizes the use of emergency regulations under the Endangered Species Act to support timber production. The Secretary of the Interior, as the Chairman of the Endangered Species Committee, is tasked with ensuring prompt reviews of exemption applications.

## Addressing the Threat to National Security from Imports of Timber, Lumber (Presidential Actions, March 1, 2025)

The executive order issued on March 1, 2025, addresses the national security threat posed by the import of timber, lumber, and their derivative products. The order highlights the importance of the wood products industry to the United States' national security, economic strength, and industrial resilience. Despite having ample timber resources and the capacity to meet most of its softwood consumption, the U.S. has been a net importer of lumber since 2016. The order emphasizes the need for a strong domestic lumber industry to support both civilian construction and military needs, as the military spends significantly on construction and innovative building materials. The policy aims to ensure a reliable and secure domestic supply chain for these products, addressing unfair foreign subsidies and support that could impair national security.

To tackle these issues, the Secretary of Commerce is directed to initiate an investigation under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act to assess the impact of timber and lumber imports on national security. This investigation will consider factors such as domestic demand, production capacity, foreign supply chains, and the effects of foreign subsidies and trade practices. The Secretary of Commerce is required to consult with the Secretary of Defense and other relevant agencies and submit a report within 270 days, detailing findings and recommendations for mitigating threats, including potential tariffs or incentives to boost domestic production.

## Amendment to Duties to Address the Flow of Illicit Drugs across our Northern Border (Presidential Actions, March 2, 2025)

The executive order issued on March 2, 2025, by the President of the United States aims to address the flow of illegal drugs across the northern border with Canada. It amends previous orders by specifying that certain goods, which were previously eligible for duty-free treatment under the "de minimis" rule, will lose this status once the Secretary of Commerce confirms that systems are in place to collect tariffs on these goods. This action is part of broader efforts to combat drug trafficking and related issues at the northern border, highlighting the administration's focus on national security and public health concerns related to illicit drugs.

## Amendment to Duties to Address the Situation at our Southern Border (Presidential Actions, March 2, 2025)

The executive order issued on March 2, 2025, by the President of the United States amends previous orders related to duties imposed to address issues at the southern border. It modifies the conditions under which certain goods can receive duty-free treatment, specifying that this treatment will end once the Secretary of Commerce confirms that systems are in place to efficiently collect tariffs on these goods. The order also clarifies that it does not change the authority of any executive department or agency, nor does it create any new legal rights for individuals against the U.S. government.

## Addressing Risks from Perkins Coie LLP (Presidential Actions, March 6, 2025)

The executive order issued by President Trump targets the law firm Perkins Coie LLP, accusing it of engaging in dishonest and dangerous activities that have negatively impacted the United States for years. The order highlights the firm's involvement in creating a false dossier during the 2016 presidential campaign and working with activist donors to overturn election laws. Additionally, Perkins Coie is accused of racial discrimination in its hiring and promotion practices, which allegedly violate civil rights laws. The administration aims to end such discriminatory practices and ensure that federal benefits align with national security and democratic principles.

The order mandates a review of security clearances held by individuals at Perkins Coie, with the potential suspension of these clearances if deemed inconsistent with national interests. It also requires the cessation of government-provided goods and services to the firm. Furthermore, the order instructs government contracting agencies to scrutinize and potentially terminate contracts with Perkins Coie or entities doing business with them. This is part of a broader effort to prevent taxpayer dollars from supporting activities that undermine democratic processes and promote discrimination.

The executive order also addresses racial discrimination by directing the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to review the practices of large law firms for compliance with civil rights laws. It restricts Perkins Coie employees' access to federal buildings and limits government engagement with the firm. Overall, the order reflects the administration's commitment to addressing perceived threats to national security and democratic integrity while promoting accountability and equality.

## Establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile (Presidential Actions, March 6, 2025)

President Trump has issued an executive order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a United States Digital Asset Stockpile. This move is aimed at positioning the U.S. as a leader in the digital asset space. The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve will hold Bitcoin, which is often referred to as "digital gold" due to its scarcity and security. The U.S. government already holds a significant amount of Bitcoin, but this order formalizes its status as a strategic asset. The Digital Asset Stockpile will manage other digital currencies seized through legal proceedings. The goal is to manage these assets strategically without incurring additional costs to taxpayers.

The Secretary of the Treasury is tasked with setting up offices to manage these reserves. The Bitcoin Reserve will include Bitcoin seized through criminal or civil asset forfeiture, while the Digital Asset Stockpile will include other digital assets. Agencies are required to review and report their holdings to facilitate the transfer of assets to these reserves. The government will not actively purchase more Bitcoin or other digital assets unless it is budget-neutral. The assets in these reserves are not to be sold, except under specific legal circumstances, such as returning them to crime victims or using them for law enforcement.

This initiative has sparked debate and criticism. Some see it as a positive step towards recognizing Bitcoin as a strategic asset, while others criticize the lack of active purchasing and the inclusion of other cryptocurrencies in the stockpile. Critics argue that this could lead to market distortion and a loss of public trust. The long-term impact of this policy on the U.S. economy and the global cryptocurrency market remains to be seen.

## Establishing The White House Task Force on the FIFA World Cup 2026 (Presidential Actions, March 7, 2025)

The President of the United States has signed an executive order to establish a White House Task Force for the FIFA World Cup 2026. This task force is created to oversee and coordinate the preparations for the event, which is expected to be the largest sporting event in history. The President will chair the task force, with the Vice President serving as vice chair. An Executive Director will be appointed to manage the day-to-day operations. The task force will include various high-ranking officials such as the Secretaries of State, Treasury, Defense, and others. It will work with federal agencies to ensure the successful planning and execution of the World Cup events, which are expected to attract millions of international visitors and have a significant economic impact.

The task force will be housed within the Department of Homeland Security, which will provide funding and administrative support. Each agency involved will submit reports on their preparations by June 1, 2025. The task force is set to disband on December 31, 2026, unless extended by the President. This initiative aligns with the President's broader economic agenda, aiming to use the global spotlight to attract foreign investment and strengthen America's position as a top destination for sports and tourism. The task force's creation is seen as a critical step to ensure a seamless and secure experience for all visitors, and it is expected to create around 200,000 jobs and generate an economic impact of approximately $40 billion.

## Restoring Public Service Loan Forgiveness (Presidential Actions, March 7, 2025)

The Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program was created in 2007 to encourage people to work in public service by forgiving their student loans after 10 years of service and payments. However, the previous administration misused the program by forgiving loans for employees who hadn't met the required payment period, diverting funds to organizations that didn't serve the public interest and sometimes engaged in harmful activities. This misuse led to increased tuition costs and unsustainable debt for students in low-demand fields. The current administration aims to correct these issues by ensuring that organizations involved in illegal activities, such as supporting terrorism or violating immigration laws, are excluded from the PSLF program.

The President has ordered the Secretary of Education to revise the PSLF program rules to exclude organizations with illegal purposes from being considered as public service. This includes organizations involved in illegal immigration, terrorism, child abuse, and other illegal activities. The goal is to protect national security and ensure that taxpayer funds are used appropriately, aligning the PSLF program with its original intent of supporting genuine public service roles.

## U.S. Hostage and Wrongful Detainee Day, 2025 (Presidential Actions, March 9, 2025)

On U.S. Hostage and Wrongful Detainee Day, President Trump expressed his commitment to bringing home Americans held captive abroad and ensuring their captors face justice. He highlighted the successful release of 13 Americans since taking office, including those detained in Venezuela, Afghanistan, Belarus, and Russia. Despite these successes, the President emphasized that more Americans still need to be freed and vowed to continue efforts until all are safely returned. The day, designated by Congress, serves as a reminder of the ongoing struggle to free Americans wrongfully detained and the importance of peace through strength. The President called on Americans to observe the day with activities that honor those affected and to fly the Hostage and Wrongful Detainee flag as a symbol of support.

## Nominations Sent to the Senate (Presidential Actions, March 11, 2025)

The White House announced a list of nominations sent to the Senate on March 11, 2025. These nominations include various positions such as ambassadors, assistant secretaries, and other key roles within the government. For example, Richard Anderson from Virginia has been nominated to be an Assistant Secretary of the Air Force, and John Arrigo from Florida is nominated to be the Ambassador to the Portuguese Republic. Other notable nominations include Thomas Barrack as Ambassador to Turkey and Leo Brent Bozell III as CEO of the United States Agency for Global Media. These nominations are part of the process where the President selects individuals to fill important government positions, which then require Senate confirmation.

The list also includes nominations for roles such as the Under Secretary of the Navy, Administrator of Drug Enforcement, and various ambassadorial positions to countries like the Dominican Republic, Malta, and Chile. Additionally, there are nominations for positions within the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Defense, among others. Each nominee will undergo a confirmation process that involves background checks, committee hearings, and a Senate vote. This process ensures that the nominees are thoroughly vetted and deemed suitable for their respective roles before they can officially assume their positions.

## Ensuring the Enforcement of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c) (Presidential Actions, March 11, 2025)

The memorandum from the White House addresses concerns about activist organizations obtaining broad injunctions that interfere with government policy-making. These organizations, often funded by large donations and sometimes government grants, are accused of undermining the democratic process by using the courts to influence executive decisions. They are said to engage in "forum-shopping" to find favorable courts for their cases, which are often meritless and used for fundraising and political purposes. This practice burdens taxpayers, who end up paying for the costs of these legal actions and delays in government policies they support. Additionally, it diverts the Department of Justice's resources from more critical tasks like public safety.

To counter this, the memorandum emphasizes the importance of enforcing Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c), which requires parties seeking injunctions to provide security to cover potential costs and damages if the injunction is wrongly issued. This rule aims to deter frivolous lawsuits and protect parties from unnecessary expenses. The memorandum directs executive departments and agencies to ensure that courts require plaintiffs to post security for potential government costs and damages in such cases. This policy seeks to hold litigants accountable and ensure that taxpayers are not unfairly burdened by the costs of unwarranted legal actions against the government.

## Additional Recissions of Harmful Executive Orders and Actions (Presidential Actions, March 14, 2025)

President Trump has issued an executive order to rescind several executive actions and orders from the previous administration led by President Biden. This is part of Trump's broader effort to reverse policies he considers harmful and to restore what he describes as "common sense" governance. The order specifically revokes a range of executive actions related to COVID-19 response, national security, human rights, minimum wage for federal contractors, energy supply, and more. The goal is to align federal policies with Trump's vision of governance, which emphasizes reducing regulations and promoting American prosperity.

This action follows a previous order where Trump rescinded 78 executive actions from the Biden administration, highlighting his commitment to undoing what he perceives as the negative impacts of Biden's policies. The overall aim is to enhance the effectiveness of the federal government and unleash the potential of American citizens.

## Addressing Risks from Paul Weiss (Presidential Actions, March 14, 2025)

The executive order issued by President Trump targets the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, accusing it of engaging in activities that undermine American principles and security. The order highlights past actions by the firm, such as a pro bono lawsuit related to the January 6 Capitol events and the hiring of Mark Pomerantz, who allegedly pursued unethical legal actions against Trump. The administration claims that Paul Weiss discriminates based on race and sex under the guise of diversity policies, which it argues are inconsistent with U.S. interests. As a result, the order seeks to end government sponsorship of the firm and restrict its access to federal resources and contracts.

The order mandates a review of security clearances held by individuals at Paul Weiss, with the potential suspension of these clearances if deemed inconsistent with national interests. It also instructs federal agencies to identify and cease the provision of government goods and services to the firm. Furthermore, the order requires government contractors to disclose any business with Paul Weiss and allows for the termination of contracts involving the firm. This move is part of a broader effort by the administration to align federal funding and resources with national security and democratic values.

Additionally, the order includes provisions to limit the interaction between federal employees and Paul Weiss, restricting the firm's access to government buildings and employment opportunities. It emphasizes the administration's commitment to preventing racial discrimination and ensuring that federal benefits support U.S. laws and policies. The order is part of a series of actions taken by President Trump against major law firms, raising concerns among legal experts about the potential impact on the legal profession and citizens' access to legal representation.

## Continuing the Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy (Presidential Actions, March 14, 2025)

The President has issued an order to continue reducing unnecessary parts of the federal government. This involves cutting non-essential functions and staff in several agencies, such as the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service and the United States Agency for Global Media, among others. Each agency must report back within a week to confirm they are following this order and explain which parts of their operations are legally required. The order also directs budget reviewers to reject funding requests that don't align with this reduction plan, unless needed for expected closures.

## Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of The United States by Tren De Aragua (The White House, March 15, 2025)

The proclamation issued by President Trump on March 15, 2025, addresses the threat posed by Tren de Aragua (TdA), a Venezuelan criminal organization designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. TdA has infiltrated the United States, conducting irregular warfare and hostile actions. The group collaborates with Cártel de los Soles, a narco-terrorism enterprise supported by the Nicolas Maduro regime in Venezuela. TdA's activities include crimes such as murder, kidnapping, extortion, and trafficking of humans, drugs, and weapons. The organization aims to harm U.S. citizens, undermine public safety, and destabilize democratic nations in the Americas, aligning with the Maduro regime's objectives.

The proclamation highlights the close ties between TdA and the Maduro regime, including infiltration into Venezuela's military and law enforcement. Tareck El Aissami, a former governor and Vice President of Venezuela, played a significant role in TdA's growth. El Aissami is a fugitive in the U.S., facing charges related to narcotics trafficking. Similarly, Nicolas Maduro, claiming to be Venezuela's President, maintains connections with narco-terrorists and leads Cártel de los Soles. This enterprise uses illegal narcotics to target the U.S., with Maduro and other regime members charged with narcoterrorism in 2020.

The proclamation declares that Venezuelan authorities have ceded control to criminal organizations like TdA, creating a hybrid criminal state that threatens the U.S. INTERPOL Washington confirmed TdA's significant threat as it infiltrates migration flows from Venezuela. Evidence shows TdA's ongoing invasion and irregular warfare within the U.S., using drug trafficking as a weapon. Based on these activities, the Secretary of State designated TdA as a Foreign Terrorist Organization on February 20, 2025.

President Trump, invoking the Alien Enemies Act, directs the apprehension and removal of TdA members in the U.S. who are not naturalized or lawful permanent residents. The proclamation outlines steps for the Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security to enforce these actions, including collaboration with law enforcement at all levels. The proclamation emphasizes the need to protect public safety and prevent TdA members from residing in the U.S., with all executive departments and agencies instructed to use lawful means to achieve these objectives.

## Achieving Efficiency Through State and Local Preparedness (The White House, March 19, 2025)

President Trump has issued an executive order aimed at improving national security and resilience by empowering state and local governments to take a more active role in preparedness. The order emphasizes that preparedness should be managed at the state, local, and individual levels, with support from the federal government. This approach is intended to make infrastructure and communities more resilient to threats such as cyber attacks, wildfires, and hurricanes. By allowing states to make informed infrastructure decisions, the order aims to benefit taxpayers and enhance national security.

The executive order outlines a policy that encourages state and local governments, as well as individuals, to play a significant role in national resilience. This policy is expected to save lives, secure livelihoods, and reduce taxpayer burdens by increasing efficiency. The order also calls for the federal government to streamline its operations and update policies to better serve Americans. This includes enabling state and local governments to better understand and address the needs of their citizens, thereby fostering collective prosperity.

To implement these changes, the order mandates the development of a National Resilience Strategy and a review of critical infrastructure policies. The strategy will be published within 90 days and reviewed every four years. Additionally, the order requires the creation of a National Risk Register to identify and quantify risks to national infrastructure. The federal government will also propose changes to improve communication and understanding between state, local, and federal entities. These efforts aim to modernize and streamline national preparedness and continuity policies, ensuring a more resilient and efficient response to threats and hazards.

## Removing Discrimination and Discriminatory Equity Ideology From the Foreign Service (The White House, March 19, 2025)

The memorandum from President Donald J. Trump, dated March 19, 2025, addresses the removal of discriminatory practices and ideologies from the U.S. Foreign Service. It highlights that over the past four years, divisive policies have infiltrated federal government processes, including hiring and performance evaluations. The memorandum emphasizes that hiring for foreign policy positions should be based solely on merit, without consideration of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. It instructs the Secretary of State to revise the criteria for tenure and promotion in the Foreign Service to eliminate references to "Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility." Additionally, it directs that no recruitment or promotion decisions should be influenced by discriminatory equity ideologies.

The memorandum further outlines that any current Foreign Service members found to have engaged in illegal discrimination based on race or other protected characteristics should face appropriate actions. This includes determining whether to refer such cases to the President or taking action under the Secretary's authority. Overall, the memorandum seeks to ensure that merit-based hiring and non-discrimination are upheld in the Foreign Service, removing any influence of discriminatory ideologies.

## Improving Education Outcomes by Empowering Parents, States, and Communities (Presidential Actions, Executive Orders, March 20, 2025)

President Donald Trump has issued an executive order aimed at closing the U.S. Department of Education and returning control over education to individual states and local communities. The order argues that federal control over education has failed, citing low reading and math scores among students as evidence. The Department of Education, established in 1979, is criticized for its bureaucracy and inefficiency, with the executive order suggesting that its closure would improve educational outcomes and program implementation. The order also highlights the Department's management of a large student loan debt portfolio, comparing it to a major bank, and suggests that these functions should be handled by entities better equipped to serve students.

The executive order directs the Secretary of Education to take steps to close the Department while ensuring that essential services and programs continue without interruption. It emphasizes compliance with federal law and administration policies, particularly concerning the allocation of federal funds and the termination of programs promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion. However, the order acknowledges that closing the Department entirely would require congressional action, and it is expected to face legal challenges. The order reflects a broader Republican critique of federal involvement in education and aims to empower states and communities to take control of educational policies and outcomes.

## Immediate Measures to Increase American Mineral Production (Presidential Actions, Executive Orders, March 20, 2025)

The executive order issued by President Donald J. Trump on March 20, 2025, aims to boost American mineral production. The order emphasizes the importance of domestic mineral resources for creating jobs, enhancing prosperity, and reducing reliance on foreign nations. It highlights that minerals are crucial for transportation, infrastructure, defense, and technology. The order notes that the U.S. was once a leading producer of minerals but has seen a decline due to strict federal regulations. This decline poses a threat to national and economic security, making it essential to increase domestic mineral production.

The order defines key terms related to mineral production, such as "mineral," "mineral production," "processed minerals," and "derivative products." It outlines the steps to identify and expedite priority mineral production projects. Within 10 days, relevant agencies must provide a list of projects to the National Energy Dominance Council (NEDC). The NEDC will then identify projects that can be quickly approved and take necessary actions to expedite permits. The order also calls for industry feedback on regulatory challenges and strategies to speed up mineral production.

The executive order addresses land use for mineral projects, directing the Secretary of the Interior to identify federal lands with mineral deposits. These lands should prioritize mineral production, and relevant agencies must identify sites suitable for leasing or development. The order encourages collaboration between the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, and private entities to establish commercial mineral production enterprises. It also emphasizes the importance of providing favorable terms and conditions for private parties involved in mineral production projects.

To accelerate investment in mineral production, the order delegates authority to the Secretary of Defense and the CEO of the United States International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) to use the Defense Production Act for strategic resources. It waives certain requirements to address the national energy emergency and encourages public and private capital investment. The order also calls for the development of a dedicated mineral production fund and outlines steps for the Export-Import Bank and the Small Business Administration to support mineral production financing and small businesses in the sector.

## Eliminating Waste and Saving Taxpayer Dollars by Consolidating Procurement (Presidential Actions, Executive Orders, March 20, 2025)

President Donald J. Trump issued an executive order on March 20, 2025, aimed at centralizing federal procurement for common goods and services under the General Services Administration (GSA). This move is intended to streamline procurement processes, reduce waste, and save taxpayer dollars by eliminating duplication across various federal agencies. The GSA, originally established in 1949 to provide an efficient procurement system, will now be the primary entity responsible for managing these procurement activities. This consolidation is expected to allow federal agencies to focus more on their core missions while optimizing government spending.

The executive order outlines specific timelines and responsibilities for implementation. Within 60 days, agency heads must propose plans to transition procurement responsibilities to the GSA. The GSA Administrator is tasked with submitting a comprehensive plan to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) within 90 days. Additionally, the GSA will manage Government-wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs) for information technology, aiming to reduce contract duplication and inefficiencies. The order does not exempt the Department of Defense or the Department of Homeland Security, which may face challenges due to their unique procurement needs. The centralization effort is part of a broader initiative to improve federal procurement practices and achieve cost savings.

## Strengthening the Suitability and Fitness of the Federal Workforce (Presidential Actions, Presidential Memoranda, March 20, 2025)

President Donald Trump issued a memorandum to enhance the suitability and fitness of the federal workforce by giving the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) more authority. The OPM Director is tasked with making final decisions on whether federal employees are suitable for their roles based on their conduct after being hired. This includes the power to direct agencies to remove employees who do not meet suitability criteria. The OPM is also instructed to propose new regulations to support this authority, which will only take effect after these regulations are finalized. The memorandum emphasizes that these changes should not interfere with existing legal authorities or create new legal rights for individuals. The goal is to ensure that federal employees meet certain standards of conduct, with the OPM having the final say in these matters.

## Stopping Waste, Fraud, and Abuse by Eliminating Information Silos (Presidential Actions, Executive Orders, March 20, 2025)

The executive order issued by President Trump on March 20, 2025, aims to improve government efficiency by removing barriers that prevent federal employees from accessing government data. The order emphasizes the importance of sharing data between agencies to reduce duplication and inefficiency, and to enhance the government's ability to detect overpayments and fraud. It defines key terms such as "Agency" and "Agency Head" and mandates that agency leaders ensure federal officials have full access to unclassified records and data. This includes facilitating both intra- and inter-agency sharing of information to support the administration's priorities in identifying and eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse.

The order requires agency heads to review and modify any guidance or regulations that hinder data sharing within 30 days. It also mandates that the federal government have access to data from state programs receiving federal funding. The Secretary of Labor is specifically directed to access unemployment data and related records. The order supersedes previous executive orders that obstruct data sharing and calls for a review of classified information policies to ensure they do not unnecessarily restrict access.

## Addressing Remedial Action by Paul Weiss (Presidential Actions, Executive Orders, March 21, 2025)

President Trump issued an executive order on March 21, 2025, revoking a previous order that targeted the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP for its alleged role in undermining the judicial process. The firm agreed to significant policy changes, including adopting political neutrality in client selection and attorney hiring, committing to merit-based hiring instead of diversity policies, and dedicating $40 million in pro bono legal services to support various causes like veterans' assistance and combating anti-Semitism. These changes led to the revocation of the initial order, which had aimed to suspend security clearances and terminate federal contracts with the firm. The President emphasized that if the legal profession focuses on justice and community support, it would benefit all Americans.

The directive also includes revoking their unescorted access to secure government facilities and applies to any security clearances obtained through private employment.

## Preventing Abuses of the Legal System and the Federal Court (Presidential Actions, Presidential Memoranda, March 22, 2025)

The memorandum issued by President Trump on March 22, 2025, addresses the issue of unethical conduct by lawyers and law firms, particularly when such actions threaten national security, public safety, or election integrity. The document highlights past instances of misconduct, such as the creation of a false dossier in 2016, which was used to investigate a presidential candidate. The memorandum emphasizes the need for accountability and directs the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security to enforce regulations governing attorney conduct, especially in cases involving immigration fraud and baseless legal claims against the federal government.

The memorandum outlines specific rules that attorneys must follow, such as Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, which prohibits unethical conduct in federal courts. This includes presenting legal filings for improper purposes or making unsupported factual claims. The memorandum directs the Attorney General to seek sanctions against attorneys and law firms that engage in frivolous litigation against the United States. It also calls for a review of attorney conduct over the past eight years to identify any misconduct that may require additional action, such as reassessment of security clearances or termination of federal contracts.

The directive underscores the importance of maintaining the integrity of the legal system and holding attorneys accountable for their actions. It highlights the ethical responsibilities of law firms and individual attorneys to uphold the rule of law and justice. The memorandum also instructs the Attorney General to report periodically on improvements made by law firms in adhering to these standards.

## Imposing Tariffs on Countries Importing Venezuelan Oil (Presidential Actions, Executive Orders, March 24, 2025)

The President of the United States, Donald J. Trump, has issued an executive order to impose tariffs on countries importing oil from Venezuela. This decision is based on the ongoing national emergency concerning Venezuela, which was first declared in 2015. The order highlights the threat posed by the Venezuelan regime under Nicolás Maduro, particularly due to its support for the Tren de Aragua gang, a criminal organization involved in terrorist activities. The gang's actions, along with Venezuela's destabilizing activities, are seen as threats to U.S. national security and foreign policy.

The executive order outlines the imposition of a 25% tariff on goods imported into the United States from any country that imports Venezuelan oil, either directly or indirectly. This tariff is set to take effect on April 2, 2025, and will be in addition to existing duties. The Secretary of State, in consultation with other key officials, has the authority to determine which countries will be subject to this tariff. The tariff will remain in place for one year after a country stops importing Venezuelan oil, unless an earlier termination is deemed appropriate.

The order also details the administration and enforcement of these tariffs, granting the Secretary of State and other officials the power to ensure compliance. It includes provisions for reporting and reviewing the effectiveness of the tariffs and the conduct of the Maduro regime. The order is effective from April 2, 2025, and emphasizes that it does not create any legal rights enforceable against the U.S. government. The goal of these measures is to protect U.S. interests and address the threats posed by Venezuela's actions.

## Modernizing Payments To and From America’s Bank Account (Presidential Actions, Executive Orders, March 25, 2025)

The executive order issued by President Donald Trump on March 25, 2025, aims to modernize the payment systems used by the Federal Government by transitioning from paper-based payments to electronic methods. This change is intended to reduce costs, increase efficiency, and enhance security by minimizing the risks associated with paper checks, such as fraud and theft. The order mandates that by September 30, 2025, all federal disbursements, including benefits, vendor payments, and tax refunds, should be made electronically, except in specific cases outlined in the order. The transition will involve using electronic funds transfer (EFT) methods like direct deposits and digital wallets, and the Department of the Treasury will support this shift by providing access to centralized payment systems.

The order also outlines exceptions for individuals who lack access to banking services or electronic payment systems, and for certain emergency or national security-related payments where electronic methods are not feasible. To ensure a smooth transition, the Secretary of the Treasury, in coordination with other agencies, will develop a public awareness campaign to inform recipients about the new electronic payment options. Additionally, the order emphasizes the importance of protecting sensitive information during this transition. Agencies are required to submit compliance plans and progress reports to ensure the successful implementation of the order, while also maintaining the authority and functions of existing laws and regulations.

## Protecting America’s Bank Account Against Fraud, Waste, and Abuse (Presidential Actions, Executive Orders, March 25, 2025)

The executive order signed by President Donald J. Trump on March 25, 2025, aims to protect America's financial resources by enhancing the integrity and efficiency of federal financial operations. The order highlights the importance of promoting financial integrity and operational efficiency as key responsibilities of the Federal Government. It notes that the U.S. General Fund, which acts as the nation's bank account, handles trillions of dollars in transactions annually. However, the Department of the Treasury, responsible for managing these funds, lacks adequate controls to ensure all transactions are proper. To address this, the order mandates that executive departments and agencies provide more detailed financial information to the Treasury to improve accountability and prevent fraud.

The order acknowledges that financial fraud poses a significant threat to federal programs and public trust in the government. It points out that past underinvestment in technology and challenges in accessing accurate data have hindered efforts to safeguard taxpayer dollars from fraud and improper payments. The Government Accountability Office estimates that the federal government loses between $233 and $521 billion annually due to fraud. To combat this, the order emphasizes the need for accurate financial information and transparency in how taxpayer dollars are used. It also highlights the fragmentation of disbursing authority across various federal entities, which complicates financial management and oversight.

To enhance financial integrity, the order empowers the Department of the Treasury to conduct fraud prevention screenings before disbursing funds on behalf of agencies. It requires agencies to provide the necessary information for detailed transaction tracking through the General Fund. The order also aims to improve operational efficiency by consolidating disbursing functions under the Treasury and standardizing federal financial systems. It sets policies to defend against financial fraud, increase transparency, reduce costs, and enhance the security of federal payments. The order outlines specific measures for verifying agency payments and minimizing administrative barriers to accessing data for fraud prevention.

The order also calls for the consolidation of core financial systems within federal agencies to streamline financial management. It directs the Office of Management and Budget to issue guidance for consolidating financial systems and reducing the number of Non-Treasury Disbursing Offices (NTDOs). The Treasury is tasked with centralizing and managing payments previously handled by NTDOs, ensuring seamless government payment operations. The order mandates that agencies submit compliance plans detailing their strategies for transitioning disbursing authority to the Treasury and updating systems. It emphasizes the protection of classified and personal information during implementation.

## Preserving and Protecting the Integrity of American Elections (Presidential Actions, Executive Orders, March 25, 2025)

The executive order signed by President Donald Trump aims to overhaul the U.S. election system to ensure integrity and prevent fraud. It highlights the need for stricter election protections, similar to those in other countries like India and Brazil, which use biometric databases for voter identification. The order criticizes the current U.S. system for relying on self-attestation for citizenship and allowing mail-in voting without strict deadlines. It emphasizes the importance of free, fair, and honest elections and the need for states to comply with federal laws that protect voting rights and prevent illegal voting and fraud.

The order mandates that votes must be cast and received by Election Day, aligning with federal statutes. It criticizes states that count ballots received after Election Day, comparing it to allowing late in-person voting. The order also addresses the issue of non-citizens registering to vote, highlighting the failure of states to adequately vet citizenship and the lack of enforcement by the Department of Justice. It calls for maintaining accurate voter registration lists and preventing foreign nationals from participating in elections through financial contributions or other means.

To enforce these measures, the order requires documentary proof of U.S. citizenship for voter registration in federal elections. It directs federal agencies to share data with state election officials to identify non-citizens on voter rolls. The order also emphasizes the need for voting systems to produce a voter-verifiable paper record to prevent fraud or mistakes. It calls for the Election Assistance Commission to amend voting system guidelines and condition federal funding on state compliance with these new standards.

The order also focuses on preventing foreign interference and ensuring the security of voting systems. It directs the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security to take actions to prevent non-citizens from accessing election equipment and materials. The order mandates compliance with federal laws setting a uniform Election Day and conditions federal funding on state adherence to these laws. It also prioritizes enforcement of laws preventing foreign contributions to U.S. elections and requires federal agencies to cease actions related to a previous executive order promoting access to voting.

## Addressing Risks from Jenner & Block (Presidential Actions, Executive Orders, March 25, 2025)

President Trump has issued an executive order targeting the law firm Jenner & Block LLP, accusing it of engaging in activities that harm American interests. The order highlights concerns about law firms, particularly large ones, that allegedly threaten public safety, national security, and constitutional freedoms. It claims that Jenner & Block has used its pro bono practices to support partisan causes and engage in activities that undermine justice and the interests of the United States. The order also criticizes the firm for discriminatory practices and for rehiring Andrew Weissmann, who is accused of unethical conduct during his previous government service.

The executive order mandates a review of security clearances held by individuals at Jenner & Block and calls for the suspension of any active clearances pending this review. It also requires government agencies to identify and cease any provision of goods, services, or sensitive information to the firm. Additionally, the order directs government contracting agencies to disclose any business they conduct with Jenner & Block and to terminate contracts with the firm if they are found to be inconsistent with American interests. This is part of a broader effort to prevent taxpayer dollars from supporting activities that do not align with national priorities.

Furthermore, the order includes provisions to limit interactions between government employees and Jenner & Block employees, particularly in cases where such interactions could threaten national security. It also advises against hiring employees from the firm without a waiver. The order emphasizes that it should be implemented in accordance with existing laws and does not create any enforceable rights against the United States. This action is part of President Trump's broader agenda to hold law firms accountable for conduct deemed harmful to the nation and to ensure government operations align with his administration's priorities.
