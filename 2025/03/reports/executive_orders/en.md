## Designating English as the Official Language of The United States (Presidential Actions, March 1, 2025)

On March 1, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order declaring English as the official language of the United States. This decision is rooted in the belief that a unified language strengthens national unity and facilitates the exchange of ideas among citizens. The order emphasizes that English has historically been the language of the nation's founding documents, such as the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. By designating English as the official language, the order aims to promote a cohesive society, streamline communication, and reinforce shared national values. It also encourages new Americans to learn English to better integrate into society and achieve economic success.

The executive order revokes a previous policy from 2000 that required federal agencies to provide language assistance to non-English speakers. However, it allows agencies to continue offering services in other languages if they choose. The order does not mandate changes to existing federal programs, making it largely symbolic. While more than 30 states have already made English their official language, this federal designation is seen as a victory for the English-only movement, which has been associated with efforts to limit bilingual education and immigration. Critics argue that the order contradicts the nation's tradition of embracing diversity and inclusivity.

## Immediate Expansion of American Timber Production (Presidential Actions, March 1, 2025)

The executive order issued by President Trump on March 1, 2025, aims to significantly increase the production of timber and related wood products in the United States. The order emphasizes the importance of timber production for construction, energy, and other essential activities. It highlights the need for better forest management and wildfire risk reduction to protect American lives and communities. The order criticizes existing federal policies that have limited the use of domestic timber resources, leading to reliance on foreign imports, job losses, and increased costs in construction and energy. The President calls for reversing these policies to enhance national and economic security.

To achieve these goals, the order directs the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture to issue new guidance to facilitate increased timber production and improve forest management. This includes reducing the time required to deliver timber and decreasing supply uncertainty. The order also mandates the development of a strategy to expedite the approval of forestry projects under the Endangered Species Act. Additionally, it requires setting targets for annual timber sales from federal lands and considering new categorical exclusions to streamline administrative processes related to timber production and forest management.

The order further instructs relevant agencies to eliminate delays in permitting processes and to revise or rescind regulations that burden timber production. It emphasizes the use of emergency regulations under the Endangered Species Act to support timber production. The Secretary of the Interior, as the Chairman of the Endangered Species Committee, is tasked with ensuring prompt reviews of exemption applications.

## Addressing the Threat to National Security from Imports of Timber, Lumber (Presidential Actions, March 1, 2025)

The executive order issued on March 1, 2025, addresses the national security threat posed by the import of timber, lumber, and their derivative products. The order highlights the importance of the wood products industry to the United States' national security, economic strength, and industrial resilience. Despite having ample timber resources and the capacity to meet most of its softwood consumption, the U.S. has been a net importer of lumber since 2016. The order emphasizes the need for a strong domestic lumber industry to support both civilian construction and military needs, as the military spends significantly on construction and innovative building materials. The policy aims to ensure a reliable and secure domestic supply chain for these products, addressing unfair foreign subsidies and support that could impair national security.

To tackle these issues, the Secretary of Commerce is directed to initiate an investigation under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act to assess the impact of timber and lumber imports on national security. This investigation will consider factors such as domestic demand, production capacity, foreign supply chains, and the effects of foreign subsidies and trade practices. The Secretary of Commerce is required to consult with the Secretary of Defense and other relevant agencies and submit a report within 270 days, detailing findings and recommendations for mitigating threats, including potential tariffs or incentives to boost domestic production. The order also clarifies definitions and ensures that it does not affect existing legal authorities or create enforceable rights against the U.S. government.

## Amendment to Duties to Address the Flow of Illicit Drugs across our Northern Border (Presidential Actions, March 2, 2025)

The executive order issued on March 2, 2025, by the President of the United States aims to address the flow of illegal drugs across the northern border with Canada. It amends previous orders by specifying that certain goods, which were previously eligible for duty-free treatment under the "de minimis" rule, will lose this status once the Secretary of Commerce confirms that systems are in place to collect tariffs on these goods. The order emphasizes that it should not interfere with existing legal authorities or budgetary functions and does not create any enforceable rights against the U.S. government. This action is part of broader efforts to combat drug trafficking and related issues at the northern border, highlighting the administration's focus on national security and public health concerns related to illicit drugs.

## Amendment to Duties to Address the Situation at our Southern Border (Presidential Actions, March 2, 2025)

The executive order issued on March 2, 2025, by the President of the United States amends previous orders related to duties imposed to address issues at the southern border. It modifies the conditions under which certain goods can receive duty-free treatment, specifying that this treatment will end once the Secretary of Commerce confirms that systems are in place to efficiently collect tariffs on these goods. The order also clarifies that it does not change the authority of any executive department or agency, nor does it create any new legal rights for individuals against the U.S. government. The order is to be implemented according to existing laws and available funding, ensuring that it does not interfere with the functions of government agencies or create enforceable rights for any party.

## Addressing Risks from Perkins Coie LLP (Presidential Actions, March 6, 2025)

The executive order issued by President Trump targets the law firm Perkins Coie LLP, accusing it of engaging in dishonest and dangerous activities that have negatively impacted the United States for years. The order highlights the firm's involvement in creating a false dossier during the 2016 presidential campaign and working with activist donors to overturn election laws. Additionally, Perkins Coie is accused of racial discrimination in its hiring and promotion practices, which allegedly violate civil rights laws. The administration aims to end such discriminatory practices and ensure that federal benefits align with national security and democratic principles.

The order mandates a review of security clearances held by individuals at Perkins Coie, with the potential suspension of these clearances if deemed inconsistent with national interests. It also requires the cessation of government-provided goods and services to the firm. Furthermore, the order instructs government contracting agencies to scrutinize and potentially terminate contracts with Perkins Coie or entities doing business with them. This is part of a broader effort to prevent taxpayer dollars from supporting activities that undermine democratic processes and promote discrimination.

The executive order also addresses racial discrimination by directing the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to review the practices of large law firms for compliance with civil rights laws. It restricts Perkins Coie employees' access to federal buildings and limits government engagement with the firm. Overall, the order reflects the administration's commitment to addressing perceived threats to national security and democratic integrity while promoting accountability and equality.

## Establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile (Presidential Actions, March 6, 2025)

President Trump has issued an executive order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a United States Digital Asset Stockpile. This move is aimed at positioning the U.S. as a leader in the digital asset space. The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve will hold Bitcoin, which is often referred to as "digital gold" due to its scarcity and security. The U.S. government already holds a significant amount of Bitcoin, but this order formalizes its status as a strategic asset. The Digital Asset Stockpile will manage other digital currencies seized through legal proceedings. The goal is to manage these assets strategically without incurring additional costs to taxpayers.

The Secretary of the Treasury is tasked with setting up offices to manage these reserves. The Bitcoin Reserve will include Bitcoin seized through criminal or civil asset forfeiture, while the Digital Asset Stockpile will include other digital assets. Agencies are required to review and report their holdings to facilitate the transfer of assets to these reserves. The government will not actively purchase more Bitcoin or other digital assets unless it is budget-neutral. The assets in these reserves are not to be sold, except under specific legal circumstances, such as returning them to crime victims or using them for law enforcement.

This initiative has sparked debate and criticism. Some see it as a positive step towards recognizing Bitcoin as a strategic asset, while others criticize the lack of active purchasing and the inclusion of other cryptocurrencies in the stockpile. Critics argue that this could lead to market distortion and a loss of public trust. The long-term impact of this policy on the U.S. economy and the global cryptocurrency market remains to be seen.

## Establishing The White House Task Force on the FIFA World Cup 2026 (Presidential Actions, March 7, 2025)

The President of the United States has signed an executive order to establish a White House Task Force for the FIFA World Cup 2026. This task force is created to oversee and coordinate the preparations for the event, which is expected to be the largest sporting event in history. The President will chair the task force, with the Vice President serving as vice chair. An Executive Director will be appointed to manage the day-to-day operations. The task force will include various high-ranking officials such as the Secretaries of State, Treasury, Defense, and others. It will work with federal agencies to ensure the successful planning and execution of the World Cup events, which are expected to attract millions of international visitors and have a significant economic impact.

The task force will be housed within the Department of Homeland Security, which will provide funding and administrative support. Each agency involved will submit reports on their preparations by June 1, 2025. The task force is set to disband on December 31, 2026, unless extended by the President. This initiative aligns with the President's broader economic agenda, aiming to use the global spotlight to attract foreign investment and strengthen America's position as a top destination for sports and tourism. The task force's creation is seen as a critical step to ensure a seamless and secure experience for all visitors, and it is expected to create around 200,000 jobs and generate an economic impact of approximately $40 billion.

## Restoring Public Service Loan Forgiveness (Presidential Actions, March 7, 2025)

The Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program was created in 2007 to encourage people to work in public service by forgiving their student loans after 10 years of service and payments. However, the previous administration misused the program by forgiving loans for employees who hadn't met the required payment period, diverting funds to organizations that didn't serve the public interest and sometimes engaged in harmful activities. This misuse led to increased tuition costs and unsustainable debt for students in low-demand fields. The current administration aims to correct these issues by ensuring that organizations involved in illegal activities, such as supporting terrorism or violating immigration laws, are excluded from the PSLF program.

The President has ordered the Secretary of Education to revise the PSLF program rules to exclude organizations with illegal purposes from being considered as public service. This includes organizations involved in illegal immigration, terrorism, child abuse, and other illegal activities. The goal is to protect national security and ensure that taxpayer funds are used appropriately, aligning the PSLF program with its original intent of supporting genuine public service roles.
