# El Salvador's Bitcoin Experiment: Rise and Fall of a Cryptocurrency Nation

El Salvador's pioneering experiment with Bitcoin as legal tender has come to an effective end, culminating in a stark reversal of policy that highlights the challenges of implementing cryptocurrency at a national scale. What began in 2021 as a bold financial initiative championed by President Nayib Bukele has now been substantially curtailed to secure crucial International Monetary Fund (IMF) financing. This development represents a significant turning point in the global cryptocurrency landscape, offering valuable insights into the practical limitations of digital currencies as official national tender.

## The Birth of a Bitcoin Nation

In September 2021, El Salvador made global headlines by becoming the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar. This groundbreaking move, spearheaded by President Nayib Bukele, was formalized through the "Bitcoin Law," which mandated that all businesses in the country must accept Bitcoin for goods and services. The government launched the Chivo wallet, a state-backed mobile application designed to facilitate Bitcoin transactions, and even offered citizens a $30 Bitcoin incentive for downloading it.

President Bukele's vision was ambitious and far-reaching. He portrayed Bitcoin adoption as a solution to multiple economic challenges facing the small Central American nation. The cryptocurrency was positioned as a tool for financial inclusion, potentially bringing banking services to the approximately 70% of Salvadorans who did not use traditional banks. Additionally, the government promoted Bitcoin as a means to reduce the costs of remittances, which constitute a significant portion of El Salvador's economy.

Beyond these practical aims, Bukele's government painted a utopian vision of El Salvador transforming into a "surfing and cryptocurrency paradise." The president announced plans to build "Bitcoin City," a futuristic urban center powered by geothermal energy from a nearby volcano. The city would supposedly be built in the shape of a physical Bitcoin symbol and would use volcanic energy to mine cryptocurrency. These ambitious plans were unveiled amid a theatrical presentation featuring laser-eyed memes, aliens, and an elaborate light show—symbolizing the bold, technology-driven future Bukele envisioned for his country.

## Signs of Trouble from the Beginning

Despite the enthusiastic promotion by the government, El Salvador's Bitcoin experiment faced skepticism and resistance from the outset. Polls conducted in 2021 indicated that only 15% of the population trusted Bitcoin, while approximately 70% of respondents expressed opposition to its adoption. The international crypto community celebrated El Salvador's move, but many Salvadorans took to the streets in protest against the law, reflecting a significant disconnect between the government's vision and public sentiment.

The implementation of the Bitcoin Law revealed several practical challenges that hampered its success. Many merchants across the country lacked the technical infrastructure necessary to accept Bitcoin payments. The digital divide was pronounced in a nation where a substantial portion of the population remained unbanked and many businesses operated exclusively with cash transactions. Furthermore, merchants expressed reluctance to accept Bitcoin due to its notorious price volatility, fearing that fluctuations in value could lead to financial losses.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expressed early concerns about El Salvador's Bitcoin initiative. In 2022, the IMF issued a statement cautioning against the use of Bitcoin as legal tender, stating: "There are large risks associated with using Bitcoin as legal tender, especially given the high volatility of its price. We don't recommend it. In the short-term, the costs and risks largely outweigh the benefits". This stance would later become crucial as El Salvador's economic situation deteriorated.

## The Failed Experiment: What Went Wrong

As the experiment progressed, the gap between Bukele's grand vision and the economic reality widened considerably. According to a poll published in January 2025 by Universidad Centroamericana, an overwhelming 92% of Salvadorans reported not using Bitcoin at all in the previous year. This dismal adoption rate demonstrated that despite government mandates, the cryptocurrency had failed to gain traction among the general population.

The practical benefits promised by the Bitcoin initiative also failed to materialize in meaningful ways. The anticipated boost in investment and tourism proved minimal, while the financial gains were "meagre at best" according to economic analysts. Rating agency Moody's estimated that the Bitcoin policy had cost the country approximately $375 million—a sum that significantly exceeded any profits generated from Bitcoin holdings, which themselves remained vulnerable to market volatility.

Technical difficulties plagued the implementation of Bitcoin infrastructure. The Chivo wallet, intended to be the primary vehicle for Bitcoin transactions, faced persistent issues that undermined user confidence. Additionally, Bitcoin's inherent volatility made it unsuitable as a day-to-day currency. For a population largely living paycheck to paycheck, the risk of value fluctuations presented an unacceptable financial hazard that discouraged regular usage.

Perhaps most tellingly, none of Bukele's grand infrastructure projects came to fruition. The much-hyped "Bitcoin City" never progressed beyond conceptual stages, and the promised economic renaissance powered by cryptocurrency remained elusive. As The Economist noted, Bukele had become "just the latest crypto-utopian to see his wild ideas dissolve on contact with reality".

## The IMF Deal: Economic Reality Forces Change

By late 2024, El Salvador's economy had reached a critical juncture, "teetering on the edge of default" according to economic analyses. Facing this precarious situation, the government turned to the International Monetary Fund for assistance. In December 2024, the IMF and El Salvador announced a $1.4 billion loan agreement—with one significant condition: the country would need to substantially scale back its Bitcoin policies.

The El Salvadoran congress, dominated by Bukele allies, moved swiftly to comply with the IMF's requirements. In early 2025, lawmakers passed legislation modifying six articles of the Bitcoin law and repealing three others. The reformed law eliminated the word "currency" when referring to Bitcoin, though it confusingly retained the term "legal tender". More importantly, the changes removed the obligation for businesses to accept Bitcoin in transactions or debt payments—a fundamental requirement for a currency to function as legal tender.

Economic experts highlighted the contradictory nature of the revised legislation. Carlos Acevedo, an economist and former president of El Salvador's Central Bank, called the reformed law "a monstrosity that's not understood," arguing that it should have been made explicitly clear that "bitcoin is no longer legal tender". Rafael Lemus, another economist, stated more plainly: "Bitcoin no longer has that force of legal tender. That's how it should have always remained, but the government wanted to force it and it didn't work".

The IMF's technical memorandum of understanding further specified that there should be "no voluntary accumulation of BTC by the public sector in El Salvador." Additionally, it restricted the public sector from issuing "any type of debt or tokenized instrument that is indexed to or denominated in Bitcoin". These conditions effectively ended the government's active involvement in cryptocurrency activities.

## Lessons from a Monetary Experiment

El Salvador's Bitcoin experiment offers valuable lessons about the practical challenges of implementing cryptocurrency as national currency. While blockchain technology and digital currencies continue to evolve, El Salvador's experience demonstrates that forcing adoption through government mandate does not guarantee success. The gap between techno-utopian visions and economic realities remains substantial.

The failure of the experiment raises important questions about the appropriate pace and scope of financial innovation. Bitcoin's extreme price volatility—precisely the attribute that makes it attractive to speculative investors—renders it problematic as a stable medium of exchange for everyday transactions. For a developing economy like El Salvador's, with significant poverty and economic vulnerability, such volatility presents unacceptable risks for ordinary citizens.

Despite Bitcoin's demotion, Méndez Bertolo, El Salvador's executive director, emphasized that the IMF's extended fund facility aims to provide "improvements in governance, transparency, and resilience to boost confidence and the country's growth potential." He further noted that "Bitcoin-related risks are being mitigated" through the legislative changes. This suggests a recognition that the experimental approach had created financial vulnerabilities that needed addressing.

## Conclusion: A Necessary Retreat from Digital Utopianism

El Salvador's retreat from its Bitcoin experiment represents a pragmatic acknowledgment of economic realities rather than a complete rejection of financial innovation. By scaling back its cryptocurrency ambitions to secure IMF funding, the government has prioritized immediate economic stability over speculative technological ventures. For a country facing significant economic challenges, this reprioritization arguably represents a responsible course correction.

The cryptocurrency community worldwide will likely view El Salvador's experience as a setback, but the outcome provides valuable data for future cryptocurrency implementations. Rather than condemning the experiment outright, observers might recognize that El Salvador served as a real-world laboratory that tested the limits of cryptocurrency adoption at a national scale.

As The Economist noted, Bitcoin's "demotion may be more of a blessing than a concession" for El Salvador. By moving away from mandatory implementation and returning to a voluntary approach to cryptocurrency, the country can potentially explore more sustainable ways to incorporate digital finance into its economy while maintaining the stability necessary for growth and development. The $1.4 billion IMF lifeline represents an opportunity to rebuild on more conventional economic foundations—a price worth paying for a lesson learned about the complex intersection of digital currencies and national economies.
