### Judge Sets Deadline for DOJ in Venezuelan Deportation Dispute

A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has given the Department of Justice (DOJ) until Tuesday to provide detailed information about the deportation of Venezuelan nationals, which occurred despite a court order to halt the flights. The controversy began when the Trump administration deported hundreds of alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador, citing national security concerns under the Alien Enemies Act. However, Chief Judge James Boasberg had issued an oral order to stop the deportations, which the DOJ argued was not enforceable until it was written. The judge expressed frustration over the administration's actions and demanded a written explanation by noon on Tuesday. The case has sparked a legal and political showdown, with concerns about a potential constitutional crisis due to the administration's defiance of judicial authority.

### Judge Orders Trump Administration to Rehire Fired Federal Workers

A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to reinstate thousands of probationary workers who were recently fired across multiple government agencies. The mass terminations, which occurred last month, were deemed unauthorized by the judge, as they were directed by a personnel office lacking the proper authority. The judge's decision came after a lawsuit was filed by labor unions and organizations, challenging the legality of the firings. The Trump administration, aiming to reduce the federal workforce, is now required to offer reinstatement to the affected employees and report back on compliance. The administration plans to appeal the ruling, arguing that the firings were based on performance issues. However, the judge criticized the government for dismissing employees who had previously received positive evaluations, calling the actions unjust and misleading.

### Tension at the U.S. Institute of Peace: A Standoff with DOGE

On a tense Monday afternoon, staff from Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) entered the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) building in Washington, D.C., after a dramatic standoff. The USIP, an independent nonprofit dedicated to promoting peace, found itself at the center of a conflict when DOGE staff, accompanied by police, gained access to the building despite protests. This followed an executive order from President Trump aimed at reducing the size of the federal government, which included restructuring the USIP. The institute's CEO, George Moose, condemned the entry as an illegal takeover, emphasizing that the USIP is not part of the executive branch. The situation escalated when DOGE staff, after being turned away previously, finally entered the building with police assistance, leading to a legal and political battle over the institute's independent status.

### Trump Ends Secret Service Protection for Biden's Children

President Donald Trump announced that he is ending Secret Service protection for Hunter and Ashley Biden, the adult children of former President Joe Biden. This decision comes after Trump expressed concerns about the number of agents assigned to their security details, particularly highlighting Hunter Biden's current stay in South Africa. Under federal law, former presidents and their spouses receive lifelong protection, but their children only receive it until they turn 16 or for a limited period after the presidency ends. Both Trump and Biden had previously extended this protection for their children for six months after leaving office. The Secret Service has confirmed that they will comply with Trump's directive and are working with the White House to ensure a smooth transition. This move has sparked discussions about the security needs of former presidential families and the implications of removing such protections.

### Trump to Release 80,000 Pages of JFK Assassination Files

This release is set to happen on Tuesday and is part of Trump's promise to make these files public without redactions. The files have been eagerly awaited by historians and conspiracy theorists alike, as JFK's assassination in 1963 has been surrounded by numerous theories. Trump emphasized that the release is in the public interest and fulfills a campaign promise he made. The documents are expected to provide new insights into the events surrounding JFK's assassination, which has been a topic of intrigue for decades.

### France's Playful Plea: Return Lady Liberty

A French politician, RaphaÃ«l Glucksmann, recently made headlines by humorously suggesting that the United States should return the Statue of Liberty to France. This playful remark was made in response to President Trump's controversial policies, which Glucksmann believes go against the values the statue represents. The Statue of Liberty, a gift from France to the U.S. in 1886, symbolizes freedom and democracy. Glucksmann's comments reflect his disapproval of Trump's foreign policy decisions, particularly regarding Ukraine. Despite the jest, the statue remains U.S. property and a symbol of the longstanding friendship between the two nations. The French government, led by President Emmanuel Macron, has not supported Glucksmann's call, focusing instead on maintaining diplomatic relations with the U.S. [1][2].

### Renewed Conflict: Israel's Airstrikes in Gaza

In recent news, Israel has resumed its military operations in Gaza, launching a series of large-scale airstrikes against Hamas. This escalation follows a period of relative calm after a ceasefire agreement was reached in January 2025. The Israeli military stated that the airstrikes targeted "terror targets" belonging to Hamas, resulting in significant casualties and damage. The renewed conflict has raised concerns about the humanitarian situation in Gaza, where many civilians are already struggling with the aftermath of previous conflicts. International organizations have called for restraint and a return to peace talks to prevent further loss of life and destruction. The situation remains tense as both sides brace for potential further escalation.

### Global Economy Slows as Trade Tensions Rise

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has lowered its economic growth forecasts for the U.S. and the world due to the impact of trade tariffs introduced by President Donald Trump. The global economy is now expected to grow by 3.1% in 2025, down from the previous estimate of 3.3%. In the U.S., growth is projected to slow to 2.2% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026. These changes are attributed to increased trade barriers and geopolitical uncertainties, which are affecting investment and consumer spending. The OECD warns that if these trade policies continue, they could lead to higher inflation and further economic slowdown, impacting households and businesses worldwide.

### Trump Administration Challenges Big Law Firms Over Diversity Practices

In a recent move, the Trump administration has intensified its scrutiny of major law firms by questioning their diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has sent letters to 20 prominent law firms, requesting detailed information about their DEI programs. This action is part of a broader campaign by the administration to eliminate DEI initiatives across various sectors, including federal government and private businesses. The EEOC's acting chair, Andrea Lucas, expressed concerns that some firms might be engaging in unlawful discrimination by setting explicit diversity goals. This development has sparked a debate about the legality and ethics of DEI practices in the legal industry, as some firms have been involved in lawsuits against the Trump administration. The administration's actions have raised alarms among legal experts, who argue that such measures could undermine efforts to promote diversity and inclusion in the workplace.

### Texas Midwife Faces Charges Under State's Strict Abortion Laws

In Texas, a midwife named Maria Margarita Rojas has been arrested and charged with performing illegal abortions, marking the first criminal charges under the state's near-total abortion ban. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced that Rojas, 48, allegedly operated three clinics in the Houston area where illegal abortion procedures were conducted. She faces charges of illegal performance of an abortion, a second-degree felony, and practicing medicine without a license, a third-degree felony. The charges come with severe penalties, including up to 20 years in prison for the abortion charge and up to 10 years for practicing without a license. Texas law, which bans abortions at all stages of pregnancy with limited exceptions, has been a point of contention, with opponents arguing that the law's exceptions are too vague. Rojas was arrested on March 6 and released on bond the following day, as authorities continue to investigate the case.

These seemingly harmless tools, often used to convert documents like Word files to PDFs, are being exploited by cybercriminals to gain unauthorized access to personal information. While the converters perform the advertised task, they also embed malicious software that can steal sensitive data such as social security numbers, banking credentials, and email passwords. The FBI emphasizes the importance of public awareness and education to prevent falling victim to these scams. Users are advised to keep their antivirus software updated and to be cautious when downloading files from the internet.

### Concerns Rise as Google's Gemini AI Easily Removes Watermarks from Images

Google's new AI model, Gemini 2.0 Flash, has sparked controversy due to its ability to remove watermarks from images with remarkable precision. This feature, currently available to developers, allows users to erase watermarks from copyrighted images, raising ethical and legal concerns. While the AI replaces the original watermark with its own "edited with AI" mark, the ease of removal has led to worries about potential misuse and copyright infringement. Despite being in an experimental phase, the tool's capabilities have drawn attention from both tech enthusiasts and critics, who fear it could undermine the protection of intellectual property. As the debate continues, many are calling for stricter safeguards to prevent the misuse of such powerful AI technology.
