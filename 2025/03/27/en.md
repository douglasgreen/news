### New Tariffs on Imported Cars to Protect U.S. Auto Industry

On March 26, 2025, President Donald J. Trump announced a new presidential proclamation imposing a 25% tariff on imported automobiles and automobile parts. This decision aims to address national security concerns by strengthening the domestic auto industry, which has been struggling due to supply chain disruptions and competition from foreign industries.

The proclamation highlights the vulnerabilities exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic and the need to protect the U.S. industrial base. While the tariffs are expected to bolster domestic manufacturing, they may also lead to higher car prices for American consumers and potential trade tensions with countries like Canada and Mexico, which are major sources of vehicle imports to the U.S.

### BYD Overtakes Tesla in Global EV Sales

In a remarkable turn of events, Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer BYD has surpassed Tesla in global sales, marking a significant shift in the automotive industry. BYD reported an impressive annual revenue of $107 billion for 2024, outpacing Tesla's $97.7 billion. This achievement is largely attributed to BYD's diverse product lineup, which includes both fully electric and hybrid vehicles, allowing them to sell a record 4.3 million vehicles globally.

### Court Blocks Trump's Deportation of Venezuelans Amid Legal Battle

A U.S. appeals court has upheld a decision to block the Trump administration from deporting Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. This law, rarely used since World War II, was invoked by the administration to deport individuals accused of being part of the Tren de Aragua gang. The American Civil Liberties Union argued that the deportations violated due process, as the migrants were not given a fair chance to challenge their alleged gang affiliations. The court's decision is a setback for the administration, which has faced criticism for overstepping its authority. The ruling maintains a temporary restraining order, preventing deportations until further legal proceedings can address these complex issues.

### The New York Times Battles OpenAI in Court Over Copyright Claims

In a significant legal battle, The New York Times has taken OpenAI and its financial backer, Microsoft, to court over allegations of copyright infringement. The lawsuit, which has been allowed to proceed by a federal judge, centers on claims that OpenAI's ChatGPT has used millions of copyrighted articles from the Times and other publishers without consent or payment. The publishers argue that this practice amounts to massive copyright infringement, as the data used to train ChatGPT includes their journalistic work. OpenAI, on the other hand, defends its actions under the "fair use" doctrine, claiming that the use of such data is transformative and does not compete directly with the original works. The outcome of this case could have far-reaching implications for the future of artificial intelligence and its use of copyrighted material. If the publishers succeed, it could lead to significant financial penalties for OpenAI and force a reevaluation of how AI models are trained using existing content.

### Discovery of Duonychus: The Two-Clawed Dinosaur of Mongolia

In the vast and arid Gobi Desert of Mongolia, scientists have unearthed a remarkable new species of dinosaur named Duonychus tsogtbaatari. This dinosaur, part of the Therizinosaur group, stands out due to its unique two-clawed hands, unlike its relatives that typically have three. The discovery includes exceptionally preserved claws, which are nearly a foot long and covered in a keratin sheath, similar to human fingernails. These claws likely helped Duonychus grasp and pull down vegetation for feeding. Weighing around 570 pounds and standing about 10 feet tall, this dinosaur's peculiar features have intrigued paleontologists, who describe it as an evolutionary oddity. The find not only adds to our understanding of dinosaur diversity but also highlights the Gobi Desert as a treasure trove of prehistoric life.

### The Mystery of Prototaxites: A New Form of Ancient Life

In the ancient world, long before the age of dinosaurs, a mysterious organism known as Prototaxites towered over the landscape.
