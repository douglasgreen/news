### Trump and Putin to Discuss Ukraine Peace Talks

In a bid to end the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, U.S. President Donald Trump announced that he will speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday. The discussions aim to explore a potential ceasefire and involve negotiations on dividing certain assets, such as land and power plants, between Ukraine and Russia. Trump expressed optimism about the talks, highlighting that significant groundwork has already been laid over the weekend. While Ukraine has agreed to a U.S.-proposed 30-day ceasefire, the success of the peace talks hinges on Russia's acceptance of the terms. The negotiations are delicate, as they involve sensitive issues like territorial concessions, which have been a sticking point for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and European leaders. The outcome of these talks could significantly impact the future of the region and international relations.

### USS Gravely's Unusual Mission: Strengthening the U.S.-Mexico Border

In an unexpected move, the USS Gravely, a Navy warship known for its combat role in the Middle East, has been deployed to the U.S.-Mexico border. This mission is part of the Trump administration's intensified efforts to secure the border amid immigration concerns. The deployment marks a significant shift as the Navy typically does not operate in this region, which is usually patrolled by the U.S. Coast Guard. The USS Gravely's presence aims to enhance maritime security and address issues like illegal immigration and transnational crime. This decision has sparked debate, with critics arguing that it is more of a symbolic gesture than a practical solution, given the low border traffic and the challenging terrain that makes naval operations difficult. Nonetheless, the deployment underscores the administration's commitment to using military resources to bolster national security at the border.

### U.S. Deportations to El Salvador Stir Controversy Amid Legal Challenges

In a bold move, the U.S. government deported over 250 Venezuelan migrants, accused of being part of the Tren de Aragua gang, to El Salvador, despite a federal judge's attempt to halt the process. The deportations were carried out under the Alien Enemies Act, a rarely used law, which President Trump invoked to expedite the removal of these individuals. Secretary of State Marco Rubio praised El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele for accepting the migrants and housing them in a high-security prison. This action has sparked a legal and diplomatic debate, as the judge's order to stop the deportations came too late, with planes already en route. Critics argue that the use of such an old law bypasses due process and unfairly targets Venezuelans, while supporters claim it strengthens regional security. The situation highlights the complexities of immigration enforcement and international cooperation in addressing organized crime.

### Tensions Rise as Houthis Threaten U.S. Warships in Escalating Conflict

In a recent development, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, the leader of the Houthi group in Yemen, announced a new campaign targeting U.S. warships in the Middle East. This announcement came after President Donald Trump ordered airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen, aiming to protect international shipping lanes in the Red Sea. The Houthis, backed by Iran, have been accused of disrupting global trade by attacking commercial ships. In response to the U.S. military action, al-Houthi vowed to escalate attacks, specifically targeting American military assets. The situation has heightened tensions in the region, with both sides preparing for potential further confrontations. The U.S. military has reported attempts by the Houthis to attack the USS Harry Truman, but these efforts were thwarted. The conflict underscores the ongoing instability in the region and the challenges of maintaining security in vital maritime corridors.

### Seeking New Homes: The U.S. and Israel's Plan for Gazans

In recent news, the U.S. and Israel have been exploring the possibility of relocating Palestinians from Gaza to countries in East Africa, such as Sudan, Somalia, and Somaliland. This initiative is part of a broader plan proposed by President Trump to address the ongoing conflict in Gaza and rebuild the region. The plan has sparked controversy and raised ethical concerns, as many view it as a forced displacement of Palestinians. While the U.S. and Israel have reached out to these African nations, the responses have been mixed, with some countries rejecting the idea outright. The proposal has also faced opposition from Arab nations and human rights groups, who argue that it could constitute a violation of international law. Despite the backlash, the U.S. administration remains committed to exploring all options to improve the lives of Gazans and bring stability to the region.

Bessent, speaking on NBC's "Meet the Press," reassured the public that with the right policies in place, such as tax reforms and deregulation, the markets will eventually thrive.

## Forever 21's Final Chapter: A Fashion Giant Bows Out

Forever 21, once a leading name in fast fashion, has filed for bankruptcy in the United States, marking the end of an era for the popular retailer. Known for its trendy and affordable clothing, Forever 21 was a staple in malls across the country. However, the company faced numerous challenges, including declining mall traffic, rising costs, and fierce competition from online retailers like Shein and Temu. These factors, combined with changing consumer preferences and economic pressures, led to the decision to close all U.S. locations. Despite efforts to adapt, including a partnership with Shein, Forever 21 could not overcome its financial struggles. The company will continue to honor gift cards until mid-April, as it winds down operations and closes its remaining stores by May 2025. Forever 21's international locations and e-commerce operations will remain unaffected by this filing.

## China's Economic Growth Shows Signs of Improvement

In the first two months of 2025, China's economy showed some positive signs of growth. Retail sales went up by 4%, which is better than the 3.7% increase seen in December. Industrial production also grew by 5.9%, although this was a bit slower than the previous month's growth. The equipment-making and high-tech sectors did particularly well. Investments in fixed assets increased by 4.1%, which is a significant improvement from last year's growth. These improvements are partly due to government stimulus measures. However, there are still challenges, such as a shaky economic recovery and issues in the property market. The government remains committed to its growth targets and is ready to support the economy further if needed.

### Oklahoma Wildfires Leave Trail of Destruction and Heartbreak

In Oklahoma, wildfires have caused immense devastation, leaving four people dead and over 140 injured. The fires, fueled by high winds and dry conditions, have destroyed more than 400 homes and burned 170,000 acres across the state. Residents like Jeremy Cook returned to find their homes reduced to ashes, grappling with the emotional toll of losing everything. The fires spread rapidly, overwhelming firefighters who struggled to contain them due to the extreme weather conditions.

### Underwater Doorbell Helps Scientists Catch Coral-Eating Fish in Florida

In Florida, marine scientists have developed an innovative underwater surveillance system resembling a doorbell to combat the decline of coral reefs. This system, known as the C-Bruv (coral-baited remote underwater video system), uses GoPro cameras to capture footage of fish species that prey on corals. The research revealed that redband parrotfish, foureye butterflyfish, and stoplight parrotfish were responsible for consuming over 97% of the coral used as bait. By identifying these "porch pirates," scientists can better plan coral restoration efforts, choosing sites and coral species that minimize predation. Despite challenges like equipment theft and technical issues, the project was deemed a success, offering valuable insights into fish behavior and coral predation. Future research may incorporate artificial intelligence to streamline video analysis, further aiding in the preservation of Florida's coral reefs.

### Spring Allergies Worsen as Climate Changes

As the world warms, spring allergies are becoming more severe and lasting longer. Warmer temperatures cause plants to bloom earlier and produce more pollen, which is bad news for those with allergies. This extended pollen season means more people are experiencing symptoms like itchy eyes and runny noses for longer periods. In the United States, about one in four adults and one in five children suffer from seasonal allergies. Experts warn that climate change is making these allergies worse, with higher levels of carbon dioxide in the air boosting pollen production. This situation is not only uncomfortable but also has economic impacts, as people may be less productive at work due to their symptoms. To cope, allergists recommend checking local pollen forecasts, using air purifiers indoors, and considering medications or immunotherapy for severe cases. As climate change continues, it's important to find ways to manage and reduce the impact of allergies on our lives.

### Greek Politician's Outburst at National Gallery Sparks Debate on Art and Religion

A recent incident at Greece's National Gallery has stirred a heated debate about the intersection of art, religion, and freedom of expression. Nikolaos Papadopoulos, a far-right politician, vandalized four artworks by Christoforos Katsadiotis, claiming they were blasphemous to Orthodox Christianity. The artworks, part of an exhibition titled "The Allure of the Bizarre," were caricatures of religious icons, which Papadopoulos found offensive. The attack led to the temporary closure of the gallery and sparked discussions on censorship and artistic freedom. While the politician defended his actions as a stand against what he perceived as an insult to his faith, the art community and the museum's board condemned the vandalism, emphasizing the importance of protecting artistic expression. This incident highlights the ongoing tension between traditional beliefs and contemporary art, raising questions about the limits of artistic freedom in a culturally diverse society.
