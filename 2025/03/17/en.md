### Trump and Putin to Discuss Ukraine Peace Talks

In a bid to end the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, U.S. President Donald Trump announced that he will speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday. The discussions aim to explore a potential ceasefire and involve negotiations on dividing certain assets, such as land and power plants, between Ukraine and Russia. Trump expressed optimism about the talks, highlighting that significant groundwork has already been laid over the weekend. While Ukraine has agreed to a U.S.-proposed 30-day ceasefire, the success of the peace talks hinges on Russia's acceptance of the terms. The negotiations are delicate, as they involve sensitive issues like territorial concessions, which have been a sticking point for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and European leaders. The outcome of these talks could significantly impact the future of the region and international relations.

### Trump Appoints Michelle Bowman as Federal Reserve's Top Bank Regulator

In a significant move, President Trump has chosen Michelle Bowman to be the Federal Reserve's top bank regulator. This decision marks a shift in the regulatory stance of the central bank. Bowman, who has been a member of the Fed's governing board for six years, will replace Michael Barr. Barr, appointed by former President Biden, faced criticism from major U.S. banks for his proposal to increase capital reserves. Bowman's appointment suggests a potential easing of such regulatory measures. Her experience includes serving as the state bank commissioner in Kansas and working in various federal agencies. This appointment is seen as a strategic decision by Trump to influence the direction of financial regulation in the country.

### U.S. Deportations to El Salvador Stir Controversy Amid Legal Challenges

In a bold move, the U.S. government deported over 250 Venezuelan migrants, accused of being part of the Tren de Aragua gang, to El Salvador, despite a federal judge's attempt to halt the process. The deportations were carried out under the Alien Enemies Act, a rarely used law, which President Trump invoked to expedite the removal of these individuals. Secretary of State Marco Rubio praised El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele for accepting the migrants and housing them in a high-security prison. This action has sparked a legal and diplomatic debate, as the judge's order to stop the deportations came too late, with planes already en route. Critics argue that the use of such an old law bypasses due process and unfairly targets Venezuelans, while supporters claim it strengthens regional security. The situation highlights the complexities of immigration enforcement and international cooperation in addressing organized crime.

### Trump's Bold Claim: Biden's Autopen Pardons "Void" Sparks Legal Debate

In a surprising move, former President Donald Trump declared that the pardons issued by President Joe Biden to members of the House Jan. 6 select committee and others are "VOID" because they were signed using an autopen. Trump argued that these pardons, which he claims were not personally signed or approved by Biden, should be considered invalid. However, legal experts quickly dismissed Trump's assertion, noting that the use of an autopen for signing official documents, including pardons, is a common practice and does not affect their legality. The U.S. Constitution does not specify the method of signing required for a pardon to be valid, and previous presidents have also utilized autopen for similar purposes. Despite Trump's claims, experts believe that any attempt to nullify these pardons would likely fail in court, as the power to pardon is a broad and largely unchecked presidential authority. This situation highlights the ongoing tensions and legal challenges surrounding executive powers and the use of technology in governance.

### USS Gravely's Unusual Mission: Strengthening the U.S.-Mexico Border

In an unexpected move, the USS Gravely, a Navy warship known for its combat role in the Middle East, has been deployed to the U.S.-Mexico border. This mission is part of the Trump administration's intensified efforts to secure the border amid immigration concerns. The deployment marks a significant shift as the Navy typically does not operate in this region, which is usually patrolled by the U.S. Coast Guard. The USS Gravely's presence aims to enhance maritime security and address issues like illegal immigration and transnational crime. This decision has sparked debate, with critics arguing that it is more of a symbolic gesture than a practical solution, given the low border traffic and the challenging terrain that makes naval operations difficult. Nonetheless, the deployment underscores the administration's commitment to using military resources to bolster national security at the border.

### Tensions Rise as Houthis Threaten U.S. Warships in Escalating Conflict

In a recent development, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, the leader of the Houthi group in Yemen, announced a new campaign targeting U.S. warships in the Middle East. This announcement came after President Donald Trump ordered airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen, aiming to protect international shipping lanes in the Red Sea. The Houthis, backed by Iran, have been accused of disrupting global trade by attacking commercial ships. In response to the U.S. military action, al-Houthi vowed to escalate attacks, specifically targeting American military assets. The situation has heightened tensions in the region, with both sides preparing for potential further confrontations. The U.S. military has reported attempts by the Houthis to attack the USS Harry Truman, but these efforts were thwarted. The conflict underscores the ongoing instability in the region and the challenges of maintaining security in vital maritime corridors.

### Seeking New Homes: The U.S. and Israel's Plan for Gazans

In recent news, the U.S. and Israel have been exploring the possibility of relocating Palestinians from Gaza to countries in East Africa, such as Sudan, Somalia, and Somaliland. This initiative is part of a broader plan proposed by President Trump to address the ongoing conflict in Gaza and rebuild the region. The plan has sparked controversy and raised ethical concerns, as many view it as a forced displacement of Palestinians. While the U.S. and Israel have reached out to these African nations, the responses have been mixed, with some countries rejecting the idea outright. The proposal has also faced opposition from Arab nations and human rights groups, who argue that it could constitute a violation of international law. Despite the backlash, the U.S. administration remains committed to exploring all options to improve the lives of Gazans and bring stability to the region.

## Economy & Business

### Treasury Secretary Bessent Sees Market Drop as a Positive Sign

In recent weeks, the U.S. stock market has experienced a significant decline, losing $5 trillion in value due to looming tariffs and rising inflation. Despite the concerns of many Americans about their investments, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has expressed a different perspective.

### Amazon's Bold Move: Cutting 14,000 Managerial Positions to Save Billions

Amazon is planning a significant change by laying off nearly 14,000 managers to save up to $3.5 billion annually. This decision is part of CEO Andy Jassy's strategy to streamline operations and reduce bureaucracy within the company. By increasing the ratio of individual contributors to managers, Amazon aims to operate more efficiently and quickly. The move is expected to cut down unnecessary organizational layers, allowing the company to adapt faster to market changes. While this decision will lead to job cuts, Amazon is also hiring thousands of seasonal and full-time employees for the holiday season, showing its commitment to balancing workforce needs with operational efficiency.

### PepsiCo's Big Move: Acquiring Poppi Soda

PepsiCo has announced its plan to buy Poppi, a popular prebiotic soda brand, for $1.95 billion. This deal includes tax benefits, making the net purchase price $1.65 billion. Poppi, known for its healthy soda options, has grown rapidly since its founding in 2018, even advertising during the Super Bowl. Despite facing a lawsuit over health claims, Poppi has become a favorite among health-conscious consumers. PepsiCo's decision to acquire Poppi instead of creating its own functional soda shows its commitment to expanding in the health-focused beverage market. The acquisition is still subject to regulatory approval, but it marks a significant step for PepsiCo in offering more health-oriented products.

### Robinhood Ventures into Prediction Markets with Sports Contracts

Robinhood, a popular trading app, has introduced a new feature called the prediction markets hub. This allows users to trade contracts based on the outcomes of various events, including sports tournaments and financial policies. Initially, the hub will focus on the men's and women's college basketball tournaments. This move is significant because prediction markets are a hot topic in the U.S., with ongoing legal and regulatory discussions. Robinhood is partnering with Kalshi, a regulated exchange, to offer these contracts legally. The company aims to provide a new way for users to engage with events they care about while ensuring compliance with existing regulations. This development comes after Robinhood paused a similar initiative for the Super Bowl due to regulatory concerns. As prediction markets grow, they offer insights into public opinions on significant events, but they also face scrutiny for their resemblance to gambling.

### Forever 21's Final Chapter: A Fashion Giant Bows Out

Forever 21, once a leading name in fast fashion, has filed for bankruptcy in the United States, marking the end of an era for the popular retailer. Known for its trendy and affordable clothing, Forever 21 was a staple in malls across the country. However, the company faced numerous challenges, including declining mall traffic, rising costs, and fierce competition from online retailers like Shein and Temu. These factors, combined with changing consumer preferences and economic pressures, led to the decision to close all U.S. locations. Despite efforts to adapt, including a partnership with Shein, Forever 21 could not overcome its financial struggles. The company will continue to honor gift cards until mid-April, as it winds down operations and closes its remaining stores by May 2025. Forever 21's international locations and e-commerce operations will remain unaffected by this filing.

### China's Economic Growth Shows Signs of Improvement

In the first two months of 2025, China's economy showed some positive signs of growth. Retail sales went up by 4%, which is better than the 3.7% increase seen in December. Industrial production also grew by 5.9%, although this was a bit slower than the previous month's growth. The equipment-making and high-tech sectors did particularly well.

### The Great Iguana Voyage: A Journey Across the Pacific

Millions of years ago, iguanas embarked on an incredible journey across the Pacific Ocean, traveling over 8,000 kilometers from North America to the islands of Fiji. This remarkable trip, the longest known for any land vertebrate, was made possible by iguanas clinging to rafts of floating vegetation. These natural rafts, formed by uprooted trees and plants, carried the iguanas across the vast ocean. Researchers have discovered that Fijian iguanas are closely related to desert iguanas from North America, suggesting that this epic voyage occurred around 31 million years ago. The iguanas' ability to survive without water for extended periods and their herbivorous diet, which allowed them to feed on the vegetation during the journey, made them ideal candidates for such a long-distance dispersal. This discovery not only solves the mystery of how iguanas reached Fiji but also highlights the extraordinary capabilities of these resilient reptiles.

### Spring Allergies Worsen as Climate Changes

As the world warms, spring allergies are becoming more severe and lasting longer. Warmer temperatures cause plants to bloom earlier and produce more pollen, which is bad news for those with allergies. This extended pollen season means more people are experiencing symptoms like itchy eyes and runny noses for longer periods. In the United States, about one in four adults and one in five children suffer from seasonal allergies. Experts warn that climate change is making these allergies worse, with higher levels of carbon dioxide in the air boosting pollen production. This situation is not only uncomfortable but also has economic impacts, as people may be less productive at work due to their symptoms. To cope, allergists recommend checking local pollen forecasts, using air purifiers indoors, and considering medications or immunotherapy for severe cases. As climate change continues, it's important to find ways to manage and reduce the impact of allergies on our lives.

### VA's Decision to End Transgender Care Sparks Outcry

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) recently announced a controversial decision to phase out medical treatments for transgender veterans, including hormone therapy and surgeries. This move follows an executive order from the Trump administration, which emphasizes recognizing only two biological sexes. VA Secretary Doug Collins stated that while all veterans are welcome at VA facilities, those seeking gender transition services must do so independently. This decision has been met with significant backlash from advocates and lawmakers, who argue it will have severe mental and physical health consequences for transgender veterans. Critics, including Democratic lawmakers, have labeled the rollback as "shameful and cruel," emphasizing that it undermines the dignity and well-being of transgender veterans. The VA plans to redirect funds from transgender health services to support severely injured veterans, but the specifics remain unclear. As the debate continues, many fear the impact on the mental health and safety of transgender veterans who rely on these essential services.
