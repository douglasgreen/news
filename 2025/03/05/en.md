### Trump Declares a New Era: 'Woke No Longer

President Trump addressed Congress on Tuesday, declaring that the United States is "woke no longer." In his speech, he highlighted the numerous executive orders he has signed since taking office six weeks ago. These actions, he claimed, are aimed at restoring common sense, safety, and prosperity across the nation. Among the changes, he mentioned renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America and declaring English as the official language of the country. He also emphasized his stance on cultural and social issues, stating that there are only two genders and ending diversity policies in various sectors.

The president's speech was met with mixed reactions. While many of his supporters applauded his decisive actions, critics argued that his policies could further divide the nation. Trump also announced his intention to withdraw the U.S. from international agreements like the Paris Climate Agreement and the World Health Organization. He justified these moves by emphasizing the need for America to prioritize its interests and regain its independence on the global stage. His remarks about hiring based on skill rather than race or gender sparked debates about equality and fairness in the workplace.

Despite the controversies, Trump's address received significant approval from his base. A CBS News/YouGov poll indicated that 76% of viewers approved of his speech, though the audience was predominantly Republican. The president's bold declarations and actions have set the tone for his administration, signaling a shift away from previous policies. As the nation watches closely, the impact of these changes on American society and its global relationships remains to be seen.

### Trump's Tariffs Ignite Canadian Nationalism and Political Resurgence

In recent weeks, the political landscape in Canada has been dramatically altered by President Trump's aggressive trade policies and provocative rhetoric. The imposition of hefty tariffs on Canadian goods has not only strained economic ties but also fueled a surge of nationalism across the country. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, once facing declining popularity, has emerged as a staunch defender of Canadian sovereignty, accusing Trump of attempting to destabilize Canada's economy to facilitate annexation. This bold stance has revitalized Trudeau's Liberal Party, which was previously on the brink of electoral defeat, and has rallied Canadians around a common cause: resisting American pressure and preserving their national identity.

The impact of Trump's policies extends beyond politics, affecting cultural and economic relations between the two nations. Canadian citizens have responded with a wave of patriotism, boycotting American products and renaming Americanos as "Canadianos" in coffee shops. This cultural shift is mirrored in the political arena, where Trudeau's firm response to Trump's tariffs has resonated with voters. The Prime Minister has vowed to implement retaliatory tariffs and diversify Canada's trade partnerships, emphasizing the need for economic independence from the United States. This strategy has not only bolstered Trudeau's standing but also positioned the Liberal Party as a formidable force in the upcoming elections.

As tensions continue to escalate, the future of Canada-U.S. relations remains uncertain. Trudeau's leadership has galvanized a sense of unity among Canadians, who are determined to protect their sovereignty and economic interests. The political resurgence of the Liberal Party, coupled with rising anti-Trump sentiment, has shifted the electoral landscape, challenging the once-dominant Conservative Party. As Canada braces for the economic impact of the tariffs, the nation stands united in its resolve to resist external pressures and assert its independence on the global stage.

### Trump’s Tariff Twist: A Break for Canada and Mexico’s Auto Industry

In a surprising move, President Donald Trump has put a temporary stop to his plan to add tariffs on cars and auto parts coming from Canada and Mexico. These tariffs, set at 25%, were meant to start soon but are now paused for one month after talks with the leaders of both countries. Trump had wanted the tariffs to push Canada and Mexico to do more about drugs and immigrants crossing into the U.S., but the auto industry worried it would make cars more expensive and hurt jobs. For now, the pause gives car makers a break and a chance to figure things out, while Trump says he’ll keep watching to see if the two countries keep their promises.

Three doctors found an easy fix: switch from bottled water to filtered tap water. This one change can drop the number of microplastics you take in from 90,000 to just 4,000 a year—cutting it by almost 90%. It’s a small step that could make a big difference for your body.

### Bacterial Vaginosis: A Hidden Sexually Transmitted Infection

For a long time, doctors thought bacterial vaginosis, a common vaginal infection, was just caused by an imbalance of bacteria in a woman’s body. But new studies show it might actually be a sexually transmitted disease (STD). Researchers found that men can pass it to women during sex, making it possibly the most common STI in the world. This discovery surprised many because the infection, which can cause itching and a bad smell, was not linked to sexual activity before. Now, scientists are working to understand more about how it spreads and how to stop it.
