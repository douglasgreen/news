### Trump Declares a New Era: 'Woke No Longer

President Trump addressed Congress on Tuesday, declaring that the United States is "woke no longer." In his speech, he highlighted the numerous executive orders he has signed since taking office six weeks ago. These actions, he claimed, are aimed at restoring common sense, safety, and prosperity across the nation. Among the changes, he mentioned renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America and declaring English as the official language of the country. He also emphasized his stance on cultural and social issues, stating that there are only two genders and ending diversity policies in various sectors.

The president's speech was met with mixed reactions. While many of his supporters applauded his decisive actions, critics argued that his policies could further divide the nation. Trump also announced his intention to withdraw the U.S. from international agreements like the Paris Climate Agreement and the World Health Organization. He justified these moves by emphasizing the need for America to prioritize its interests and regain its independence on the global stage. His remarks about hiring based on skill rather than race or gender sparked debates about equality and fairness in the workplace.

Despite the controversies, Trump's address received significant approval from his base. A CBS News/YouGov poll indicated that 76% of viewers approved of his speech, though the audience was predominantly Republican. The president's bold declarations and actions have set the tone for his administration, signaling a shift away from previous policies. As the nation watches closely, the impact of these changes on American society and its global relationships remains to be seen.

### Senator Slotkin's Call for Responsible Change

She highlighted the importance of a strong middle class, national security, and democratic values. Slotkin criticized the President's economic policies, arguing that they have not effectively addressed consumer costs and expressed concern over potential cuts to essential programs like Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security. She also raised issues about government efficiency and oversight, criticizing the President's approach to diplomacy, particularly his meeting with the Ukrainian President. Slotkin encouraged citizens to engage actively and hold elected officials accountable, presenting a Democratic perspective on current issues and advocating for shared values and responsible governance. Her speech underscored the challenges of balancing bipartisanship with strong opposition within the Democratic base, positioning her as a voice for those seeking common ground.

### Al Green's Stand: A Night of Protest in Congress

During President Donald Trump's address to Congress, Democratic Representative Al Green from Texas made headlines by interrupting the speech with a bold protest. As Trump began discussing his electoral victory, Green stood up and shouted, "Mr. President, you don't have a mandate!" referring to proposed Medicaid cuts. His protest was quickly drowned out by Republican chants of "U-S-A!" and he was subsequently escorted out of the chamber by the Sergeant-at-Arms. Green, a long-time critic of Trump, remained defiant, stating that it was important to stand up against the president's plans to cut essential healthcare programs like Medicaid. This incident highlighted the deep partisan divide in Congress, with Democrats expressing their dissent through various forms of protest, including wearing symbolic attire and holding signs. Despite the disruption, Trump continued his speech, asserting that his administration was just getting started.

## Trump's Tariffs Ignite Canadian Nationalism and Political Resurgence

In recent weeks, the political landscape in Canada has been dramatically altered by President Trump's aggressive trade policies and provocative rhetoric. The imposition of hefty tariffs on Canadian goods has not only strained economic ties but also fueled a surge of nationalism across the country. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, once facing declining popularity, has emerged as a staunch defender of Canadian sovereignty, accusing Trump of attempting to destabilize Canada's economy to facilitate annexation. This bold stance has revitalized Trudeau's Liberal Party, which was previously on the brink of electoral defeat, and has rallied Canadians around a common cause: resisting American pressure and preserving their national identity.

The impact of Trump's policies extends beyond politics, affecting cultural and economic relations between the two nations. Canadian citizens have responded with a wave of patriotism, boycotting American products and renaming Americanos as "Canadianos" in coffee shops. This cultural shift is mirrored in the political arena, where Trudeau's firm response to Trump's tariffs has resonated with voters. The Prime Minister has vowed to implement retaliatory tariffs and diversify Canada's trade partnerships, emphasizing the need for economic independence from the United States. This strategy has not only bolstered Trudeau's standing but also positioned the Liberal Party as a formidable force in the upcoming elections.

As tensions continue to escalate, the future of Canada-U.S. relations remains uncertain. Trudeau's leadership has galvanized a sense of unity among Canadians, who are determined to protect their sovereignty and economic interests. The political resurgence of the Liberal Party, coupled with rising anti-Trump sentiment, has shifted the electoral landscape, challenging the once-dominant Conservative Party. As Canada braces for the economic impact of the tariffs, the nation stands united in its resolve to resist external pressures and assert its independence on the global stage.

### Trump's New Tariffs: A Bigger Impact Than Before

In 2025, President Trump introduced a new wave of tariffs that are much broader and more impactful than those during his first term. Unlike the targeted tariffs of 2018 and 2019, which were implemented with some constraints and allowed for company appeals, the new tariffs are across-the-board. This means they affect a wider range of products and are implemented more swiftly, without the usual processes for exceptions. The tariffs are expected to disrupt supply chains and lead to noticeable price increases for consumers. Economists warn that these changes could slow GDP growth and increase inflation, making the economic impact more visible to Americans than in previous years. Despite the potential for economic disruption, the administration is considering ways to de-escalate tensions with trading partners like Canada and Mexico, which could mitigate some of the negative effects.

### Celebrating the Pioneers of AI: Barto and Sutton's Reinforcement Learning Triumph

This year, the prestigious Turing Award, often referred to as the "Nobel Prize of Computing," has been awarded to Andrew Barto and Richard Sutton. These two pioneers are recognized for their groundbreaking work in reinforcement learning, a key approach in artificial intelligence. Reinforcement learning is a technique where computers learn from their own experiences, much like how animals learn through rewards and punishments. Barto and Sutton's work laid the foundation for this approach, which has become central to many AI advancements today. Despite facing skepticism in the early days of their research, their perseverance has paid off, as their methods are now integral to the development of intelligent systems.

In a joint interview, Barto and Sutton expressed their gratitude for receiving the award, highlighting the challenges they faced when their work was not widely accepted. Sutton noted the significance of the award, as it aligns with Alan Turing's early ideas about machines learning from experience. Their contributions have not only advanced AI technology but have also inspired a new generation of researchers. Reinforcement learning is now used in various applications, from programming robots to improving language models. As AI continues to evolve, Barto and Sutton's work remains a cornerstone, demonstrating the power of learning from experience in both machines and humans.

### TCL Surpasses LG in Premium TV Market

In a surprising turn of events, TCL has overtaken LG to become the second-largest premium TV brand globally. This shift was highlighted by a significant increase in TCL's premium TV shipments, which more than doubled in the last quarter of 2024, capturing 20% of the market. Meanwhile, LG's market share fell to 19%, marking a notable decline from its previous 26% share in 2023.
