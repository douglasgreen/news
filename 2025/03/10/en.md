The new tax affects electricity exports to states like New York, Michigan, and Minnesota, impacting 1.5 million American homes and businesses. Premier Ford expressed regret for the impact on American citizens but emphasized the necessity of the measure to counteract the economic strain caused by the tariffs.

### ICE Arrests Palestinian Activist at Columbia University

Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist and former graduate student at Columbia University, was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in New York City. Khalil, who holds a green card, was taken into custody from his university-owned apartment.

### Voyager's Journey: A Race Against Time in the Vast Unknown

NASA's Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft, launched in 1977, have been exploring the far reaches of space for nearly five decades. As the most distant human-made objects, they have provided invaluable data about our solar system and beyond. However, their power supply is dwindling, losing about 4 watts each year. To extend their mission, NASA engineers have begun shutting down some of their scientific instruments. Recently, Voyager 1's cosmic ray subsystem and Voyager 2's low-energy charged particle instrument were turned off. This decision aims to conserve energy, allowing the spacecraft to continue their groundbreaking exploration of interstellar space. Despite the challenges, NASA hopes to keep at least one instrument operational on each probe into the 2030s, continuing to gather unique data from regions no other spacecraft has reached. Every day could be their last, but each day also holds the promise of new discoveries in the vast unknown.

### Megalodon: The Sleek Giant of the Ancient Seas

Scientists have recently discovered that the megalodon, a giant prehistoric shark, might not have been as bulky as once thought. Instead of resembling a massive great white shark, new research suggests that the megalodon had a more slender and elongated body, similar to a lemon shark. This shape would have allowed it to move more efficiently through the water, reaching lengths of up to 80 feet. By studying the fossilized remains of megalodon vertebrae and comparing them to various shark species, researchers have provided a more accurate picture of this ancient predator. The findings not only change our understanding of the megalodon's appearance but also offer insights into how certain marine animals achieve such gigantic sizes. This research highlights the importance of using diverse data sources to reconstruct the past and reminds us of the mysteries that still surround these fascinating creatures.

### Supreme Court to Review Colorado's Ban on Conversion Therapy

The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case challenging Colorado's ban on conversion therapy, a controversial practice aimed at changing an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity. The case was brought by Kaley Chiles, a licensed counselor and practicing Christian, who argues that the ban infringes on her First Amendment rights to free speech and religious expression. Chiles claims that some of her clients seek her guidance to reconcile their faith with their sexual orientation or gender identity. Colorado officials, however, maintain that the law regulates harmful professional conduct rather than speech, aiming to protect minors from practices deemed unsafe and ineffective by medical professionals. The Supreme Court's decision to hear this case could have significant implications, as more than 20 states have enacted similar bans. The case is set to be argued in the court's next term, beginning in October, with a decision expected by June 2026.

In a game that was already slipping away from the Los Angeles Lakers, LeBron James added a dramatic twist that quickly became the talk of social media. During the fourth quarter of the Lakers' 111-101 loss to the Boston Celtics, LeBron attempted to draw a foul from Jayson Tatum with a flop that many fans found more suited for a Hollywood script than an NBA court.
