Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist and former graduate student at Columbia University, was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in New York City.

### Megalodon: The Sleek Giant of the Ancient Seas

Scientists have recently discovered that the megalodon, a giant prehistoric shark, might not have been as bulky as once thought. Instead of resembling a massive great white shark, new research suggests that the megalodon had a more slender and elongated body, similar to a lemon shark. This shape would have allowed it to move more efficiently through the water, reaching lengths of up to 80 feet. By studying the fossilized remains of megalodon vertebrae and comparing them to various shark species, researchers have provided a more accurate picture of this ancient predator. The findings not only change our understanding of the megalodon's appearance but also offer insights into how certain marine animals achieve such gigantic sizes. This research highlights the importance of using diverse data sources to reconstruct the past and reminds us of the mysteries that still surround these fascinating creatures.
