### Trump Keeps Elise Stefanik in Congress to Safeguard GOP Majority

President Donald Trump decided to withdraw the nomination of Representative Elise Stefanik for the position of U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. This decision was made to ensure that the Republican Party maintains its slim majority in the House of Representatives. Trump emphasized the importance of keeping every Republican seat in Congress to advance his agenda. Stefanik, a strong ally of Trump, was initially expected to be confirmed by the Senate, but concerns about the GOP's narrow margin led to the change in plans. Trump expressed his appreciation for Stefanik's contributions and asked her to continue her work in Congress. This move highlights the strategic importance of maintaining party strength in the House, especially with upcoming special elections that could impact the balance of power.

### White House Plans Major Layoffs Across U.S. Agencies

An internal document from the White House has revealed plans for significant layoffs across various U.S. government agencies. The document outlines potential staff reductions ranging from 8% to 50% as part of an initiative led by President Donald Trump to streamline the federal government. The aim is to reduce waste and improve efficiency, but the plans have raised concerns about the impact on government services. For example, the Department of Housing and Urban Development might lose half of its workforce, while the IRS could see a reduction of nearly one-third of its employees. Although these plans are still in draft form and subject to change, they indicate a substantial shift in how the government might operate in the future. The White House has stated that these are preliminary plans and that final decisions will be announced by the respective agencies when ready.

### Musk's Bold Plan: Trillion-Dollar Cuts Without Hurting Services

Elon Musk, leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has announced a plan to cut $1 trillion from federal spending by the end of May. Despite the massive scale of these cuts, Musk assures that essential government services will remain unaffected. The plan involves reducing over half of the $1.8 trillion spent on non-defense discretionary programs in 2024. Musk, a special government employee, is confident that these reductions can be achieved without compromising critical services. However, the ambitious cuts have sparked political debate, with some questioning the feasibility and potential impact on federal programs. Critics argue that while Musk's efforts target waste and inefficiency, the real challenge lies in addressing the larger mandatory spending programs like Medicare and Social Security, which are less flexible for cuts. Despite the controversy, Musk remains optimistic about achieving the trillion-dollar savings goal within the set timeframe.

### GOP Faces Unexpected Challenges in Florida Special Election

In Florida's 6th Congressional District, Republicans are feeling anxious as the special election approaches. The GOP's candidate, Randy Fine, handpicked by former President Donald Trump, is struggling against Democrat Josh Weil, who has significantly outraised him. Despite the district's strong Republican history, Fine's campaign has been criticized for its slow start and lack of fundraising. Meanwhile, Weil's aggressive campaign has focused on issues like protecting Social Security and Medicare, resonating with voters. As election day nears, both parties are closely watching the race, with Republicans hoping to maintain their hold and Democrats aiming to make significant inroads in a traditionally red area.

In a recent speech at the International Arctic Forum in Murmansk, Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed concerns over the United States' renewed interest in Greenland, a territory rich in minerals and strategically located in the Arctic.

### GameStop's Bold Move: Issuing Bonds to Buy Bitcoin

GameStop, the well-known video game retailer, has announced a significant financial decision to issue $1.3 billion in convertible bonds. These bonds will be sold privately to investors, and the funds raised will be used for general corporate purposes, including the purchase of Bitcoin. This move comes after GameStop updated its investment policy to allow Bitcoin acquisitions. However, the market reacted negatively to this news, with GameStop shares experiencing a 15% decline in intraday trading. The bonds, which mature in 2030, can be converted into GameStop's common stock by the bondholders. This strategy mirrors similar approaches by other companies aiming to invest in Bitcoin. Despite the short-term drop in stock price, GameStop's shares have seen significant growth over the past year, increasing by over 80%. The long-term impact of this financial strategy remains uncertain, and further analysis is needed to understand its implications fully.

### Perkins Coie Stands Firm Against Trump's Legal Onslaught

Perkins Coie, a prominent law firm, has taken a bold stand against President Trump's aggressive actions aimed at undermining their operations. Recently, Trump issued an executive order that stripped the firm's lawyers of their security clearances and restricted their access to government buildings, citing their past work with Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign as a threat to national security. In response, Perkins Coie filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the order, arguing that it violates fundamental legal principles and threatens their ability to represent clients effectively. Despite the potential financial and operational repercussions, Perkins Coie remains resolute, with support from other law firms rallying behind them. This legal battle highlights the tension between the executive branch and the legal community, as firms grapple with the implications of standing up to presidential power.

### U.S. Revokes Hundreds of Visas Linked to Pro-Palestinian Protests

In a recent move, the U.S. State Department, led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, has revoked over 300 visas, primarily targeting foreign students involved in pro-Palestinian protests on American campuses. This action is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to curb what it perceives as anti-Israeli rhetoric and activities. The revocations have sparked controversy, with critics arguing that they infringe on free speech and academic freedom. One high-profile case involves Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, who was detained by immigration officers after expressing support for Palestinians in a campus newspaper. Rubio defended the visa cancellations, stating that the U.S. has the right to remove individuals who engage in activities deemed disruptive or harmful to national interests. This crackdown has raised concerns about the balance between national security and civil liberties, as well as the potential impact on international students studying in the U.S.

### U.S. Investigates California Universities Over Affirmative Action Policies

The U.S. Department of Justice has launched investigations into Stanford University and three University of California campuses—Berkeley, UCLA, and UC Irvine—over their admissions policies. This move follows a 2023 Supreme Court ruling that ended affirmative action in college admissions. The Trump administration, led by Attorney General Pam Bondi, is scrutinizing whether these schools are complying with the ruling, which prohibits considering race in admissions decisions. The administration argues that diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs may unfairly disadvantage white and Asian American students. The universities have stated their commitment to following the law, with Stanford noting it has already adjusted its admissions process. The investigations are part of a broader effort by the administration to eliminate what it sees as race-based preferences in education and other areas.

### Trump Aims to Change Smithsonian Museums with New Executive Order

President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to change the way Smithsonian museums operate. The order focuses on removing what Trump calls "improper ideology" from the museums, which he believes promote divisive and race-centered narratives. Vice President JD Vance has been tasked with overseeing this initiative. The order aims to ensure that federal funding does not support programs that Trump feels degrade American values or promote ideologies inconsistent with federal law. This move is part of a broader effort by Trump to reshape cultural institutions in line with conservative values, including restoring monuments and revising museum exhibits to reflect what he considers a more accurate portrayal of American history. The Smithsonian Institution, which includes 21 museums and the National Zoo, has not yet commented on the order.

A powerful earthquake with a magnitude of 7.7 struck Myanmar on March 28, 2025, causing significant damage in Mandalay and sending shockwaves across the region. The quake's epicenter was near Sagaing, just northwest of Mandalay, and its shallow depth intensified the impact, leading to the collapse of several buildings. Witnesses in Mandalay reported seeing structures fall, including a five-story building and a tea shop where people were trapped inside. The tremors were felt as far as Bangkok, Thailand, where an under-construction high-rise building collapsed, resulting in casualties and injuries. Emergency services are working tirelessly to rescue those trapped under the rubble, while authorities in both Myanmar and Thailand have declared emergency zones to manage the crisis. The earthquake has raised concerns about the region's preparedness for natural disasters, especially in areas already struggling with political and economic challenges.
