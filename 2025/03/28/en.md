### Trump Keeps Elise Stefanik in Congress to Safeguard GOP Majority

President Donald Trump decided to withdraw the nomination of Representative Elise Stefanik for the position of U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. This decision was made to ensure that the Republican Party maintains its slim majority in the House of Representatives. Trump emphasized the importance of keeping every Republican seat in Congress to advance his agenda. Stefanik, a strong ally of Trump, was initially expected to be confirmed by the Senate, but concerns about the GOP's narrow margin led to the change in plans. Trump expressed his appreciation for Stefanik's contributions and asked her to continue her work in Congress. This move highlights the strategic importance of maintaining party strength in the House, especially with upcoming special elections that could impact the balance of power.

### White House Plans Major Layoffs Across U.S. Agencies

An internal document from the White House has revealed plans for significant layoffs across various U.S. government agencies. The document outlines potential staff reductions ranging from 8% to 50% as part of an initiative led by President Donald Trump to streamline the federal government. The aim is to reduce waste and improve efficiency, but the plans have raised concerns about the impact on government services. For example, the Department of Housing and Urban Development might lose half of its workforce, while the IRS could see a reduction of nearly one-third of its employees. Although these plans are still in draft form and subject to change, they indicate a substantial shift in how the government might operate in the future. The White House has stated that these are preliminary plans and that final decisions will be announced by the respective agencies when ready.

### Musk's Bold Plan: Trillion-Dollar Cuts Without Hurting Services

Elon Musk, leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has announced a plan to cut $1 trillion from federal spending by the end of May. Despite the massive scale of these cuts, Musk assures that essential government services will remain unaffected. The plan involves reducing over half of the $1.8 trillion spent on non-defense discretionary programs in 2024. Musk, a special government employee, is confident that these reductions can be achieved without compromising critical services. However, the ambitious cuts have sparked political debate, with some questioning the feasibility and potential impact on federal programs. Critics argue that while Musk's efforts target waste and inefficiency, the real challenge lies in addressing the larger mandatory spending programs like Medicare and Social Security, which are less flexible for cuts. Despite the controversy, Musk remains optimistic about achieving the trillion-dollar savings goal within the set timeframe.

In Florida's 6th Congressional District, Republicans are feeling anxious as the special election approaches. The GOP's candidate, Randy Fine, handpicked by former President Donald Trump, is struggling against Democrat Josh Weil, who has significantly outraised him. Despite the district's strong Republican history, Fine's campaign has been criticized for its slow start and lack of fundraising. Meanwhile, Weil's aggressive campaign has focused on issues like protecting Social Security and Medicare, resonating with voters. As election day nears, both parties are closely watching the race, with Republicans hoping to maintain their hold and Democrats aiming to make significant inroads in a traditionally red area.

### Mark Carney's Bold Gamble with Trump Pays Off for Canada

Mark Carney, the new Prime Minister of Canada, has taken a bold approach in dealing with U.S. President Donald Trump, unlike many other world leaders who have been cautious. Carney's strategy involves standing firm against Trump's aggressive trade policies and demands, which has resonated well with Canadian voters. Recently, Carney and Trump had a productive phone call where they agreed to start comprehensive negotiations on a new economic and security relationship after Canada's upcoming election. This call marked a shift in tone from Trump's previous threats and hostile rhetoric towards Canada.

### Wall Street's Rough Day: Stocks Fall Amid Inflation and Tariff Concerns

On a challenging day for Wall Street, the stock market experienced a significant drop as worries about inflation and upcoming tariffs weighed heavily on investors' minds. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by over 700 points, marking a 1.7% decrease, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq also saw substantial declines. This downturn was driven by fears of rising inflation and the potential impact of new tariffs announced by President Trump, which could affect consumer spending and economic growth. Companies like Lululemon and Delta Air Lines were among those hit hardest, as concerns about consumer confidence and spending grew. Despite some positive earnings reports, the overall sentiment remained cautious, with many investors uncertain about the future economic landscape. As the market continues to navigate these challenges, all eyes are on the upcoming tariff announcements and their potential effects on the global economy.

### GameStop's Bold Move: Issuing Bonds to Buy Bitcoin

GameStop, the well-known video game retailer, has announced a significant financial decision to issue $1.3 billion in convertible bonds. These bonds will be sold privately to investors, and the funds raised will be used for general corporate purposes, including the purchase of Bitcoin. This move comes after GameStop updated its investment policy to allow Bitcoin acquisitions. However, the market reacted negatively to this news, with GameStop shares experiencing a 15% decline in intraday trading. The bonds, which mature in 2030, can be converted into GameStop's common stock by the bondholders. This strategy mirrors similar approaches by other companies aiming to invest in Bitcoin. Despite the short-term drop in stock price, GameStop's shares have seen significant growth over the past year, increasing by over 80%. The long-term impact of this financial strategy remains uncertain, and further analysis is needed to understand its implications fully.

### Judge Stops Trump's Plan to Close Consumer Protection Agency

A federal judge has temporarily stopped former President Donald Trump from closing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). This agency was created after the 2008 financial crisis to protect people from unfair financial practices. Trump wanted to shut it down, but the judge said that the court must act to keep it open while a lawsuit is ongoing. The lawsuit argues that the administration does not have the power to close an agency that Congress created. The judge's decision means the CFPB will continue its work, which includes helping people with financial complaints and protecting them from fraud, until a final decision is made in court.

### Presidential Pardon for Nikola Founder Sparks Controversy

Trevor Milton, the founder of the electric vehicle company Nikola, was recently granted a presidential pardon by Donald Trump. Milton had been convicted of fraud for misleading investors about the capabilities of his company's technology. He was sentenced to four years in prison but had not yet begun serving his sentence due to an ongoing appeal. The pardon has stirred debate, as it could potentially erase the restitution that prosecutors were seeking for the investors who lost money. Milton, who had donated significantly to Trump's campaign, expressed his gratitude on social media, calling the pardon a "sacred pardon of innocence." The White House confirmed the pardon, although it was not listed on their official website. Critics argue that the pardon undermines the justice system, while supporters claim it corrects an overzealous prosecution.

### Perkins Coie Stands Firm Against Trump's Legal Onslaught

Perkins Coie, a prominent law firm, has taken a bold stand against President Trump's aggressive actions aimed at undermining their operations.

In response, Perkins Coie filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the order, arguing that it violates fundamental legal principles and threatens their ability to represent clients effectively. Despite the potential financial and operational repercussions, Perkins Coie remains resolute, with support from other law firms rallying behind them. This legal battle highlights the tension between the executive branch and the legal community, as firms grapple with the implications of standing up to presidential power.

### U.S. Investigates California Universities Over Affirmative Action Policies

The U.S. Department of Justice has launched investigations into Stanford University and three University of California campuses—Berkeley, UCLA, and UC Irvine—over their admissions policies. This move follows a 2023 Supreme Court ruling that ended affirmative action in college admissions. The Trump administration, led by Attorney General Pam Bondi, is scrutinizing whether these schools are complying with the ruling, which prohibits considering race in admissions decisions. The administration argues that diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs may unfairly disadvantage white and Asian American students. The universities have stated their commitment to following the law, with Stanford noting it has already adjusted its admissions process. The investigations are part of a broader effort by the administration to eliminate what it sees as race-based preferences in education and other areas.

President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to change the way Smithsonian museums operate. The order focuses on removing what Trump calls "improper ideology" from the museums, which he believes promote divisive and race-centered narratives. Vice President JD Vance has been tasked with overseeing this initiative. The order aims to ensure that federal funding does not support programs that Trump feels degrade American values or promote ideologies inconsistent with federal law. This move is part of a broader effort by Trump to reshape cultural institutions in line with conservative values, including restoring monuments and revising museum exhibits to reflect what he considers a more accurate portrayal of American history. The Smithsonian Institution, which includes 21 museums and the National Zoo, has not yet commented on the order.

### Microsoft’s Quantum Chip Faces Skepticism at Global Physics Summit

At the Global Physics Summit, Microsoft presented its new topological quantum chip, claiming it could revolutionize quantum computing. The chip, known as Majorana 1, is designed to use topological qubits, which are believed to be more stable and less error-prone than traditional qubits. However, many physicists at the summit were not convinced by the evidence presented. The data, which was supposed to demonstrate the chip's effectiveness, appeared too noisy and lacked clear signals of qubit behavior. Critics argued that the methods used to verify the presence of Majorana quasiparticles, essential for the chip's function, were unreliable and could lead to false positives. Despite the skepticism, some experts remain hopeful that with further refinement, Microsoft's approach could eventually lead to significant advancements in quantum computing.

### The Mystery of Sue: A Fossil from the Depths of Time

In a remarkable discovery, scientists have uncovered a 444-million-year-old fossil named "Sue," revealing a new species with its internal structures perfectly preserved. Found in the Soom Shale of South Africa, this fossil is unique because it is preserved from the inside out, with its muscles, sinews, and even guts intact, while its external features like the carapace, legs, and head are missing. The fossil's preservation is attributed to the toxic, anoxic conditions of the marine basin where it was found, which protected it from decay during a mass extinction event. Despite its age, Sue's unusual state makes it difficult for scientists to place it within the evolutionary tree of arthropods, leaving its precise evolutionary relationships a mystery. This discovery, led by Professor Sarah Gabbott, highlights the complexity and beauty of ancient life and the challenges of interpreting such rare finds.
