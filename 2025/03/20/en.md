### Tensions Rise as DOGE Raids U.S. Institute of Peace

The U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP), a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting peace and religious freedom, found itself at the center of a legal battle after a raid by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). This raid, which took place at USIP's Washington headquarters, was part of the Trump administration's broader efforts to cut foreign aid programs. The administration, led by adviser Elon Musk, had previously labeled USIP as "unnecessary" in an executive order aimed at reducing federal bureaucracy. The raid led to a lawsuit filed by USIP against DOGE, President Trump, and newly appointed board members, accusing them of trespassing and attempting to seize control of the institute's infrastructure. Despite the controversy, a federal judge allowed DOGE to maintain control, though expressed concern over their aggressive tactics. The situation highlights the ongoing tension between the administration's cost-cutting measures and the mission of organizations like USIP, which play a crucial role in global peace efforts.

### Maine Faces Federal Pressure Over Transgender Athletes in Sports

In a recent development, the U.S. Department of Education has ordered Maine to ban transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports, citing a violation of Title IX antidiscrimination laws. This decision follows a heated exchange between President Donald Trump and Maine's Democratic Governor, Janet Mills, at a White House meeting.

Governor Mills has expressed her intent to challenge the order in court, arguing that it conflicts with Maine's Human Rights Act. This situation highlights the ongoing national debate over transgender rights and sports participation, with legal and political implications that could extend beyond Maine.

### Ben & Jerry's vs. Unilever: A Clash Over Social Activism

Ben & Jerry's, known for its progressive values, is in a legal battle with its parent company, Unilever. The dispute began when Unilever removed Ben & Jerry's CEO, David Stever, allegedly due to his support for the brand's social mission.

The conflict has been brewing since Ben & Jerry's decided to stop selling ice cream in the West Bank, a move that Unilever opposed. The ice cream company accuses Unilever of trying to silence its political statements, including those about Palestine and Donald Trump. Unilever, on the other hand, argues that it has followed the merger agreement and that Ben & Jerry's activism has become too controversial.

### A Cosmic Puzzle: New Map of Galaxies Challenges Our Understanding of Dark Energy

Scientists have created a massive 3D map of the universe, charting nearly 15 million galaxies and quasars. This map, part of the DESI survey, is helping researchers explore the mysterious force known as dark energy, which is believed to drive the universe's expansion. Surprisingly, the new data suggests that dark energy might not be constant over time, as previously thought. Instead, it could be evolving, which challenges the standard model of cosmology. By combining this data with other cosmic observations, scientists are finding that the influence of dark energy may be changing, hinting at a more complex universe than we imagined. This discovery could lead to a major shift in our understanding of the cosmos and its future.

### AI Outshines Humans in Meme Humor, But Human Creativity Still Shines

A recent study has revealed that AI-generated meme captions are often funnier than those created by humans. This research, which involved comparing meme captions across categories like work, food, and sports, found that AI models consistently produced memes that scored higher in humor, creativity, and shareability. Despite this, the study highlighted that the best individual memes were still crafted by humans, showcasing the unique creativity that people bring to meme-making. While AI can generate content that appeals to a broad audience, human creativity remains essential for creating content that resonates on a deeper level. The study suggests that while AI can boost productivity, it doesn't necessarily enhance the quality of memes when humans collaborate with AI. This finding underscores the importance of human creativity in producing exceptional and memorable memes.
