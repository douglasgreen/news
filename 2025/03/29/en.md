### AI's Secret Poetry Planning: A Peek Inside Claude's Mind

Scientists at Anthropic were in for a surprise when they asked their AI model, Claude, to complete a simple poem. Expecting the model to choose words one by one, they instead discovered that Claude was planning ahead. When given the prompt "He saw a carrot and had to grab it," Claude responded with "His hunger was like a starving rabbit." Using a new technique to look inside the model's neural network, researchers found that Claude had already considered the word "rabbit" while processing the first line. This finding challenges the belief that AI models merely predict the next word in a sequence. It suggests that these models might be capable of more complex planning than previously thought, raising questions about what else might be happening inside these advanced systems. This discovery was part of a broader study by Anthropic, revealing new insights into how large language models think and operate [1][2].

### A Celestial Dance: Partial Solar Eclipse Graces the Skies on Saturday

On Saturday, March 29, 2025, a partial solar eclipse will captivate skywatchers across parts of the Northern Hemisphere. As the moon glides between the Earth and the sun, it will cast a shadow, partially obscuring the sun and creating a stunning crescent shape in the sky. This celestial event will be visible in various regions, including parts of North America, Europe, Africa, and Asia. In the United States, early risers in the Northeast will witness the eclipse at sunrise, with cities like Portland, Maine, experiencing maximum coverage of 64% shortly after the sun peeks over the horizon. To safely enjoy this astronomical spectacle, viewers are advised to use proper eye protection, such as eclipse glasses, or indirect viewing methods like a pinhole projector. This partial eclipse is a reminder of the intricate dance between celestial bodies and offers a unique opportunity to connect with the wonders of our universe.

### A Galaxy's Surprise: Powerful Jets in a Spiral

Scientists have discovered a galaxy named 2MASX J23453268−0449256, located nearly 1 billion light-years from Earth, that challenges what we know about galaxies. This galaxy is a spiral, much like our Milky Way, but it hosts a supermassive black hole that emits powerful jets of energy into space. Such jets are usually found in much larger elliptical galaxies formed by mergers, not in spirals. The discovery has surprised researchers because these jets can destabilize a spiral galaxy, yet this one remains intact. This finding suggests that our understanding of how galaxies and black holes evolve might need to be reconsidered, as this galaxy seems to thrive despite its unusual conditions.
