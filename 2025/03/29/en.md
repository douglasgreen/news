This request comes after a federal appeals court blocked the administration's efforts, citing the Alien Enemies Act, a rarely used 18th-century law. The administration argues that the deportations are necessary for national security and diplomatic reasons, while opponents, including the American Civil Liberties Union, argue that the law is being misused and that migrants should have the right to challenge their deportation.

### Overcrowding Concerns as ICE Detains Nearly 50,000 Migrants

In recent news, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has reported detaining nearly 50,000 migrants, marking a significant increase from previous years.

The administration has responded by announcing plans to open additional facilities to accommodate the rising numbers. Meanwhile, the legal system is also feeling the pressure, with immigration courts in places like Minnesota experiencing a backlog of cases.

### AI's Secret Poetry Planning: A Peek Inside Claude's Mind

Scientists at Anthropic were in for a surprise when they asked their AI model, Claude, to complete a simple poem. Expecting the model to choose words one by one, they instead discovered that Claude was planning ahead. When given the prompt "He saw a carrot and had to grab it," Claude responded with "His hunger was like a starving rabbit." Using a new technique to look inside the model's neural network, researchers found that Claude had already considered the word "rabbit" while processing the first line. This finding challenges the belief that AI models merely predict the next word in a sequence. It suggests that these models might be capable of more complex planning than previously thought, raising questions about what else might be happening inside these advanced systems. This discovery was part of a broader study by Anthropic, revealing new insights into how large language models think and operate.

### A Galaxy's Surprise: Powerful Jets in a Spiral

Scientists have discovered a galaxy named 2MASX J23453268−0449256, located nearly 1 billion light-years from Earth, that challenges what we know about galaxies.
