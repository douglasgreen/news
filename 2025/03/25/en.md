### Venezuelan Women Caught in Deportation Confusion

Last week, eight Venezuelan women were deported from the U.S. to El Salvador, only to be returned to the U.S. shortly after. These women were part of a larger group of alleged gang members deported under the Alien Enemies Act. However, upon arrival in El Salvador, the women were not accepted because the Salvadoran government refused to detain females or individuals from other Central American countries. This unexpected turn of events led to their return to the U.S., where they remain in detention. The situation has sparked legal challenges and debates over the use of the Alien Enemies Act, with critics arguing that the deportations lacked due process and transparency. The case continues to unfold as lawyers and human rights organizations seek clarity and justice for those affected.

### Canada Updates Travel Advisory for U.S. Amid New Registration Rules

Canada has joined several European countries in updating its travel advisory for the United States, following recent changes in U.S. immigration policies under the Trump administration. The new advisory requires Canadians planning to stay in the U.S. for more than 30 days to register with U.S. authorities starting April 11. This change comes as part of a broader effort by the U.S. to monitor foreign nationals more strictly. The advisory warns that failure to comply could lead to penalties, fines, or misdemeanor charges. Previously, Canadians could visit the U.S. for extended periods without such requirements, making this a significant shift in travel norms. The update also reflects growing diplomatic concerns over the impact of U.S. policy changes on foreign visitors, particularly amid rising tensions between the two countries. As a result, many Canadians are reconsidering their travel plans to the U.S., and the Canadian Snowbird Association is actively working to amend these requirements for Canadian travelers.

### Japanese Court Orders Dissolution of Controversial Unification Church

In Japan, a court has ordered the dissolution of the Unification Church, a controversial religious group founded in South Korea.

### Curiosity Rover Uncovers Ancient Organic Molecules on Mars

NASA's Curiosity rover has made a groundbreaking discovery on Mars, detecting the largest organic molecules ever found on the Red Planet. These long-chain carbon molecules, found in a 3.7 billion-year-old rock sample from an ancient lakebed, hint at the possibility of life having once existed on Mars.
