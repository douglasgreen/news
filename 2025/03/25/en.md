### Venezuelan Women Caught in Deportation Confusion

Last week, eight Venezuelan women were deported from the U.S. to El Salvador, only to be returned to the U.S. shortly after.

This unexpected turn of events led to their return to the U.S., where they remain in detention.

### Canada Updates Travel Advisory for U.S. Amid New Registration Rules

Canada has joined several European countries in updating its travel advisory for the United States, following recent changes in U.S. immigration policies under the Trump administration.

### Japanese Court Orders Dissolution of Controversial Unification Church

In Japan, a court has ordered the dissolution of the Unification Church, a controversial religious group founded in South Korea. This decision came after the church was accused of using manipulative tactics to pressure its followers into making large donations, which often led to financial ruin for many families. The church, known for its political connections and mass weddings, has faced criticism for decades but maintained its legal status until now. The investigation into the assassination of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in 2022 revealed the church's deep ties with Japan's ruling party, which intensified scrutiny and led to the court's decision. The church plans to appeal the ruling, arguing that it threatens religious freedom and misinterprets the law.

### The Scented Statues of Ancient Greece and Rome

In ancient Greece and Rome, statues were not just visual masterpieces but also olfactory wonders. Recent research reveals that these statues were often adorned with perfumes, oils, and waxes, creating a multi-sensory experience for viewers. The practice of scenting statues was primarily a religious ritual, enhancing the veneration of gods and esteemed figures. Ancient texts and inscriptions, such as those from the Greek island of Delos, provide evidence of this tradition, mentioning the use of rose-scented perfumes and other aromatic substances. While physical traces of these scents have largely disappeared over time, the discovery of beeswax residue on a statue of Queen Berenice II suggests that these statues were indeed perfumed. This practice not only added to the statues' lifelike appearance but also played a role in preserving and protecting them. The study of these scented statues challenges the modern perception of ancient sculptures as purely visual objects, highlighting the importance of sensory experiences in ancient art and culture.

### OpenAI's ChatGPT Now Creates Images with GPT-4o

OpenAI has introduced a new feature in ChatGPT that allows users to generate images using the GPT-4o model. This feature, called "Images in ChatGPT," is available to all users, including those on the free tier, although there are usage limits similar to those of DALL-E. The new system improves on previous models by accurately representing multiple objects and their attributes, and it offers better text rendering within images. This was achieved through a new autoregressive approach, which generates images sequentially, unlike the diffusion models used by other generators. The system can create complex images, such as scientific diagrams and multi-panel comics, and even supports images with transparent backgrounds. While image generation takes longer than before, OpenAI believes the improved quality is worth the wait. Users own the images they create and can use them according to OpenAI's usage policies. The company is committed to improving its safeguards to prevent misuse of the technology.

### Curiosity Rover Uncovers Ancient Organic Molecules on Mars

NASA's Curiosity rover has made a groundbreaking discovery on Mars, detecting the largest organic molecules ever found on the Red Planet. These long-chain carbon molecules, found in a 3.7 billion-year-old rock sample from an ancient lakebed, hint at the possibility of life having once existed on Mars. While these molecules can form through non-biological processes, their presence raises exciting questions about Mars' past. The discovery suggests that the building blocks necessary for life were present on Mars, similar to those on early Earth. Scientists are eager to further analyze these findings, as they could provide crucial insights into the planet's ancient environment and the potential for life beyond Earth. This discovery marks a significant step forward in our understanding of Mars and fuels the hope that future missions might uncover more evidence of ancient life on the planet.

### NASA's Artemis Mission Faces Changes Amid DEI Language Removal

NASA's Artemis III mission, initially celebrated for its commitment to diversity by planning to land the first woman and person of color on the Moon, has recently seen a shift in its public messaging. This change comes as a result of the Trump administration's directive to remove diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) language from federal websites. While the mission's core objective of returning astronauts to the lunar surface remains unchanged, the removal of DEI language has sparked discussions about the future composition of the Artemis crew. Despite the language change, NASA assures that this does not indicate a change in crew assignments, and the agency continues to align with White House guidance while focusing on mission success. The Artemis III mission, now delayed to 2027, aims to explore more of the Moon's surface using innovative technologies, but the absence of explicit diversity goals has raised questions about the agency's commitment to inclusivity in space exploration.
