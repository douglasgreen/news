### Senate Confirms Dr. Marty Makary as FDA Chief Amid Controversy

Dr. Marty Makary, a surgeon from Johns Hopkins University, has been confirmed by the Senate as the new head of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under President Trump's administration. During his confirmation hearing, Dr. Makary emphasized his commitment to following scientific processes and restoring public trust in the FDA. However, he faced tough questions from senators about his stance on several controversial issues, including the availability of the abortion pill mifepristone and recent layoffs at the FDA. Dr. Makary assured the committee that he would thoroughly review data and consult with FDA scientists before making any policy decisions. Despite some concerns, his confirmation is seen as a step towards addressing pressing health issues, such as high drug prices and food safety, while navigating the complex political landscape surrounding the FDA.

### U.S. Tightens Grip on Chinese Tech with New Export Restrictions

The United States has recently imposed new export restrictions on 80 Chinese tech firms, citing national security concerns. This move aims to prevent these companies from acquiring advanced American technology that could be used for military purposes. Among the affected firms are major players like Nettrix and subsidiaries of the Inspur Group, which have been linked to projects involving supercomputing and artificial intelligence for military applications. The U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security announced these restrictions as part of a broader strategy to curb China's technological advancements in sensitive areas. This decision has sparked criticism from China, which argues that the restrictions violate international law and harm global supply chains. The situation adds to the ongoing tensions between the two countries, with both sides implementing measures that impact trade and technology exchanges.

### Supreme Court Upholds Ghost Gun Regulations

The Supreme Court has made a significant decision regarding ghost guns, which are self-assembled firearms that lack serial numbers, making them difficult to trace. In a 7-2 ruling, the court upheld a federal regulation that requires ghost gun kits to have serial numbers and mandates background checks for buyers. Justice Neil Gorsuch, who wrote the majority opinion, emphasized that these kits can be quickly assembled into functional firearms, thus falling under the definition of firearms in the 1968 Gun Control Act. The decision supports the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives' authority to regulate these kits, reversing a lower court's ruling that had overturned the regulation. This ruling is seen as a victory for gun control advocates, as it aims to reduce the number of untraceable firearms used in crimes. However, Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented, arguing that the regulation overreaches the intended scope of the Gun Control Act.

### Trump Signs Order Requiring Proof of Citizenship for Voter Registration

President Trump has signed a new executive order that changes how people register to vote in the United States. This order requires everyone to show proof of U.S. citizenship, like a passport or military ID, when they register to vote. The goal is to ensure that only citizens can vote, but many people are worried that this could stop millions of eligible voters from participating in elections. Critics argue that the order might not be legal because it bypasses Congress and could conflict with existing laws. The order also demands that states remove noncitizens from voter lists and share data with federal agencies to prevent election crimes. This move has sparked a lot of debate about voting rights and the balance of power between state and federal governments.

### A New Hope for Peace: Russia and Ukraine Agree to Black Sea Ceasefire

In a significant move towards peace, Russia and Ukraine have agreed to halt their conflict in the Black Sea. This agreement, facilitated by talks in Riyadh with U.S. mediators, aims to stop attacks on energy facilities and maritime operations. Both countries have expressed openness to third-party involvement to ensure the agreement is upheld. The Black Sea is crucial for both nations due to its role in their export economies, making this ceasefire particularly important. However, the full details of how the ceasefire will be implemented are still unclear, and any Russian military movement outside the eastern Black Sea could lead to Ukraine exercising its right to self-defense. This agreement marks a hopeful step towards a broader ceasefire, although challenges remain in its execution.

### Gazans Demand Change: Protests Against Hamas and War Erupt

In a rare and bold move, thousands of Palestinians in Gaza have taken to the streets for the second consecutive day to protest against Hamas and the ongoing war with Israel. The protests, which began in the northern city of Beit Lahia, have grown in size and intensity, with demonstrators chanting slogans like "Hamas out" and "We refuse to die." These protests mark the largest public dissent against Hamas since the war began over a year ago. The demonstrators are expressing their frustration with the militant group's inability to protect them and provide basic necessities amidst the devastating conflict. Despite the risk of reprisal, the protesters are calling for an end to the war and a change in leadership, highlighting the growing discontent among Gazans who are desperate for peace and stability.

### Delaware's Corporate Law Changes Spark Debate

Delaware has recently changed its corporate laws to address concerns from big businesses and influential figures like Elon Musk. These changes aim to keep Delaware as a top choice for corporations, despite some companies moving to other states like Nevada and Texas. The new law, which passed with strong support in the Senate and House, is expected to face legal challenges. Critics worry it might harm Delaware's economy by reducing the power of its courts to oversee corporate conflicts. Supporters argue that the changes will protect Delaware's economy by making its legal system more predictable and business-friendly. Governor Matt Meyer is expected to sign the bill into law soon, highlighting the importance of Delaware's corporate legal system to the state's financial health.

### GameStop's Bold Move: Investing in Bitcoin Boosts Profits

GameStop, the well-known video game retailer, has decided to invest in Bitcoin, which has led to a significant increase in its fourth-quarter profits. The company's board approved the plan to allocate some of its funds to Bitcoin and stablecoins, following a similar strategy by Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy. This decision comes as part of GameStop's efforts to restructure and improve profitability under CEO Ryan Cohen. Despite a decrease in overall revenue, the company's net income has risen due to cost-cutting measures. However, investing in Bitcoin carries risks due to its volatile nature, which GameStop acknowledged in its SEC filing. The announcement has positively impacted GameStop's stock price, which saw a rise in after-hours trading. This move is part of a broader strategy to use existing cash reserves and potential future debt or equity issuances for investment, with no set limit on Bitcoin purchases.

### Transgender Americans Fight Back Against Passport Policy Changes

In a recent legal battle, transgender Americans are challenging a new passport policy introduced by the Trump administration. This policy prevents individuals from obtaining passports that reflect their gender identity, specifically banning the use of the "X" marker for nonbinary people. Ash Lazarus Orr, a transgender man from West Virginia, is one of the plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) against the federal government. Orr's inability to secure a passport with the correct gender designation has hindered his ability to travel internationally for essential gender-affirming care. The ACLU argues that this policy is discriminatory and poses a risk of mistreatment for transgender individuals. The case is currently being heard in a Boston court, where the ACLU seeks a preliminary injunction to halt the policy while the lawsuit proceeds. The Trump administration, however, maintains that the policy is constitutional and does not harm the plaintiffs, asserting the president's authority to set passport rules.

The phenomenon occurs when charged particles from the sun interact with Earth's atmosphere, creating vibrant displays of green, pink, and purple lights. Many people gathered in open spaces away from city lights to witness this rare spectacle. The event was particularly special because it coincided with the spring equinox, a time when auroras are often more intense.
