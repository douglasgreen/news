### Senate Confirms Dr. Marty Makary as FDA Chief Amid Controversy

Dr. Marty Makary, a surgeon from Johns Hopkins University, has been confirmed by the Senate as the new head of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under President Trump's administration. During his confirmation hearing, Dr. Makary emphasized his commitment to following scientific processes and restoring public trust in the FDA. However, he faced tough questions from senators about his stance on several controversial issues, including the availability of the abortion pill mifepristone and recent layoffs at the FDA. Dr. Makary assured the committee that he would thoroughly review data and consult with FDA scientists before making any policy decisions.

### Delaware's Corporate Law Changes Spark Debate

Delaware has recently changed its corporate laws to address concerns from big businesses and influential figures like Elon Musk. These changes aim to keep Delaware as a top choice for corporations, despite some companies moving to other states like Nevada and Texas. The new law, which passed with strong support in the Senate and House, is expected to face legal challenges. Critics worry it might harm Delaware's economy by reducing the power of its courts to oversee corporate conflicts. Supporters argue that the changes will protect Delaware's economy by making its legal system more predictable and business-friendly. Governor Matt Meyer is expected to sign the bill into law soon, highlighting the importance of Delaware's corporate legal system to the state's financial health.

### GameStop's Bold Move: Investing in Bitcoin Boosts Profits

GameStop, the well-known video game retailer, has decided to invest in Bitcoin, which has led to a significant increase in its fourth-quarter profits. The company's board approved the plan to allocate some of its funds to Bitcoin and stablecoins, following a similar strategy by Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy. This decision comes as part of GameStop's efforts to restructure and improve profitability under CEO Ryan Cohen. Despite a decrease in overall revenue, the company's net income has risen due to cost-cutting measures. However, investing in Bitcoin carries risks due to its volatile nature, which GameStop acknowledged in its SEC filing. The announcement has positively impacted GameStop's stock price, which saw a rise in after-hours trading. This move is part of a broader strategy to use existing cash reserves and potential future debt or equity issuances for investment, with no set limit on Bitcoin purchases.
