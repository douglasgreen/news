### Trump Orders Strikes on Yemen's Houthis, Escalating Tensions

President Donald Trump has ordered a series of large-scale military strikes against the Houthi rebels in Yemen. This decision comes as a response to the Houthis' ongoing attacks on international shipping routes in the Red Sea. The airstrikes, which began on Saturday, targeted key Houthi strongholds, including their leadership and missile defenses. Trump has vowed to use "overwhelming lethal force" until the Iran-backed rebels cease their disruptive activities. The strikes have already resulted in significant casualties, with reports indicating at least 31 people killed, including women and children. The Houthis, known for their resilience, are expected to retaliate, potentially escalating the conflict further. This military action highlights the ongoing geopolitical tensions in the region and the complex dynamics involving Iran's support for the Houthis. As the situation unfolds, the international community watches closely, concerned about the broader implications for regional stability and global trade routes.

### Judge Halts Trump's Use of Old Law to Deport Venezuelans

In a surprising turn of events, a federal judge blocked President Trump's attempt to use an old wartime law to deport Venezuelan immigrants. Trump had invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, aiming to quickly remove members of the Tren de Aragua gang, a group he labeled as a threat to the U.S. However, Judge James Boasberg issued an order stopping the deportations, arguing that the law was not meant for peacetime immigration enforcement. The decision came after a lawsuit by the ACLU and Democracy Forward, which argued that the law was being misused. This legal battle highlights the ongoing tension between the administration's immigration policies and the judicial system.

### Trump's Approval Soars as Democrats Face Decline in Popularity

In a recent NBC News poll, President Trump's approval rating has reached a high point, with 47% of voters expressing approval of his performance. This marks one of the highest ratings of his political career. Despite this, a majority of voters still disapprove of his overall job performance. Meanwhile, the Democratic Party is experiencing a significant drop in popularity, reaching its lowest point in NBC polling history. Only 27% of voters have a positive view of the party. The poll also reveals that more registered voters believe the U.S. is heading in the right direction than at any time since 2004, although a majority still feel the country is on the wrong track. This shift in public opinion highlights the challenges Democrats face as they navigate a political landscape dominated by a unified Republican Party and a president who continues to implement controversial policies.

### Columbia University Takes Action Against Pro-Palestinian Protesters

In a significant move, Columbia University has expelled and suspended several students involved in a pro-Palestinian protest that took place last spring.
