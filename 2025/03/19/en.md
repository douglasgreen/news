### Radio Free Europe Fights Back Against Funding Cuts

Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), a U.S.-funded broadcaster, has taken legal action against the Trump administration for halting its federal funding. The broadcaster, which provides news to countries with limited press freedom, argues that the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM) violated the law by not disbursing funds allocated by Congress. RFE/RL's lawsuit highlights the importance of its mission to counter propaganda and censorship in regions like Russia and Iran. The broadcaster, which reaches millions weekly, fears that without funding, it will have to lay off staff and reduce its vital news coverage. The case underscores the ongoing debate over the role of U.S.-backed media in promoting democracy and free speech worldwide.

### Judge Stops Trump's Ban on Transgender Troops

A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's attempt to ban transgender individuals from serving in the U.S. military. This decision came after U.S. District Judge Ana C. Reyes issued a preliminary injunction, stating that the ban likely violates the constitutional rights of transgender service members. The judge's ruling prevents the Department of Defense from implementing a policy that would remove transgender troops from service. This legal action was initiated by several transgender service members who argued that the ban unfairly targets them and undermines their ability to serve their country. The ruling is seen as a significant setback for the Trump administration's agenda and highlights ongoing legal battles over the rights of transgender individuals in the military.

### Judge Stops Trump's EPA from Taking Back Climate Grants

A U.S. judge has temporarily stopped the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from taking back climate grants that were given to three environmental groups. These grants, part of a $20 billion program, were aimed at reducing pollution and were authorized during President Joe Biden's time in office. The EPA, under the leadership of Lee Zeldin, wanted to end these grants, claiming concerns about fraud and waste. However, the judge found that the EPA did not provide enough evidence to support these claims. The decision is a win for the environmental groups, allowing them to continue using the funds for their projects while the case is ongoing.

### President Trump Fires Two Democratic FTC Commissioners

In a surprising move, President Donald Trump has dismissed two Democratic commissioners from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Alvaro Bedoya and Rebecca Kelly Slaughter. This decision has sparked controversy as both commissioners claim their removal was illegal and plan to challenge it in court. The FTC, an independent agency, is responsible for enforcing consumer protection and antitrust laws. Traditionally, it includes members from both major political parties to maintain balance. The firings have raised concerns about the potential for increased political influence over the agency, with critics arguing that it could lead to less accountability and more power for large corporations. The White House, however, maintains that the president has the authority to make such decisions to ensure democratic accountability. As the legal battle unfolds, the implications for the FTC and other independent agencies remain uncertain.

### New Social Security Rules Cause Concern for Elderly and Disabled

The Social Security Administration has announced a significant change that will require millions of Americans to verify their identity in person at field offices or through an online system, rather than over the phone. This change aims to reduce fraud but is expected to create challenges for many elderly and disabled individuals who may lack access to computers or have difficulty traveling to field offices. The announcement comes amid efforts by the Trump administration, influenced by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, to downsize Social Security by cutting jobs and closing offices. Acting Commissioner Leland Dudek emphasized that these measures are necessary to ensure benefits reach the right people, despite concerns about the potential hardships for those with limited mobility or internet access. Critics argue that these changes could lead to inefficiencies and chaos, particularly as the agency plans to close several offices and lay off thousands of workers.

In Hungary, a new law has been passed that bans Pride events and allows the use of facial recognition technology to identify attendees. This move has sparked widespread protests across the country, with thousands of people taking to the streets to voice their opposition. The law, supported by Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n's right-wing populist party, is seen as part of a broader crackdown on the LGBTQ+ community.
