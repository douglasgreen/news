### White House Clarifies Role in Firing Probationary Workers

The White House recently clarified that the responsibility for firing probationary federal employees lies with individual agencies, not the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). This update follows a court ruling that stated OPM had overstepped its authority by directing such terminations. The memo, initially issued on President Trump's first day in office, was revised to reflect this change, emphasizing that probationary periods are meant to assess employee performance rather than manage staffing levels. This clarification comes amid widespread layoffs of probationary workers, raising concerns about the future of those already dismissed and the potential impact on federal workforce dynamics.

### Trade Tensions Rise as Tariffs Spark Global Retaliation

In a bold move, President Donald Trump has imposed steep tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China, igniting a trade war with these key trading partners. The tariffs, which include a 25% tax on Mexican and Canadian goods and a 20% tax on Chinese imports, have prompted swift retaliatory measures. Canada and Mexico have announced their own tariffs on American products, while China has imposed additional tariffs on U.S. farm exports. This escalation has sent shockwaves through global markets, with businesses and consumers bracing for higher prices and economic uncertainty. As tensions rise, leaders from the affected countries express their disapproval, urging for a resolution to avoid further economic disruption.

### Trump Threatens to Cut Funding for Schools Allowing 'Illegal Protests'

In a recent announcement, President Donald Trump stated that he plans to stop federal funding for schools, colleges, and universities that permit what he terms "illegal protests." This declaration has sparked widespread concern and debate, as Trump did not clarify what constitutes an illegal protest. The move comes amid ongoing pro-Palestinian demonstrations, which the Trump administration has criticized. Trump also mentioned that students involved in such protests could face severe consequences, including expulsion, arrest, or deportation. This announcement has raised questions about the balance between maintaining order and protecting free speech rights on campuses. Critics argue that this could lead to a chilling effect on student activism and free expression, as institutions might preemptively censor protests to avoid losing funding.

### BlackRock's Bold Move: Buying Panama Canal Ports Amidst Political Tensions

In a significant business move, the American asset management company BlackRock has agreed to purchase two major ports at the Panama Canal from a Hong Kong-based firm. This decision comes amidst political tensions, as former President Donald Trump had expressed concerns over Chinese influence in the region. Trump had previously stated his intention to "take back" the Panama Canal, which was handed over to Panama in 1999. The deal, valued at $22.8 billion, involves BlackRock and its partners acquiring the ports of Balboa and Cristobal, which are crucial for global trade. This acquisition is seen as a strategic move to reduce Chinese influence and strengthen American presence in the area. The Panama Canal is vital for international trade, with a significant portion of U.S. container traffic passing through it. While the White House has not commented on the purchase, it is likely to ease concerns about foreign control over this critical waterway.

### Market Turmoil: Dow Plummets Amidst Trump's Tariff Escalation

The stock market experienced a significant downturn as President Trump's new tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China took effect, sparking fears of a global trade war. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by nearly 700 points, reflecting investor anxiety over the potential economic impact. Trump's decision to impose a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico, along with an increased 20% tariff on Chinese goods, led to immediate retaliatory measures from these countries. This escalation has raised concerns about higher consumer prices and economic instability. As the market reacted to these developments, major U.S. companies like Ford and GM saw their shares drop, highlighting the widespread impact of the tariffs on the economy. Investors are now bracing for further volatility as the situation unfolds, with many hoping for a resolution to avoid prolonged economic disruption.

### New York Prisons Face Crisis Amid Strikes and Inmate Deaths

The New York prison system is currently facing a significant crisis as it deals with a strike by corrections officers and public outrage over the deaths of high-profile inmates. The strike, which began in mid-February, has been fueled by corrections officers demanding better pay, improved staffing, and safer working conditions. This unrest comes in the wake of the deaths of two inmates, Messiah Nantwi and Robert Brooks, both of whom allegedly suffered fatal beatings by corrections officers. These incidents have sparked widespread criticism and calls for reform, highlighting a culture of violence within the prison system. Governor Kathy Hochul has responded by initiating investigations and implementing measures such as body-worn cameras to increase transparency. Despite reaching an agreement to end the strike, many officers remain off the job, leading to staffing shortages and the involvement of the National Guard to maintain order. The situation underscores the urgent need for systemic change to ensure the safety and dignity of both inmates and staff within New York's correctional facilities.

### "Man with the Golden Arm": James Harrison, Who Saved Millions of Babies, Dies at 88

James Harrison, known as the "Man with the Golden Arm," has died peacefully at age 88 in a nursing home near Sydney, Australia. Harrison donated blood and plasma an incredible 1,173 times over six decades, saving more than 2 million babies' lives through his rare Anti-D antibody in his blood. After receiving blood transfusions during lung surgery at age 14, Harrison began donating at 18 and continued until he was 81, the maximum age allowed in Australia. His special antibody was used to make medication that prevents rhesus disease, a potentially fatal condition where a mother's blood attacks her unborn baby. Harrison's daughter Tracey said, "He was very proud to have saved so many lives without any cost or pain," adding that as an Anti-D recipient herself, "he has left behind a family that may not have existed without his precious donations."

### Scientists Create 'Woolly Mice' in Quest to Revive Woolly Mammoths

In an exciting development, scientists have successfully created "woolly mice" by using advanced genetic engineering techniques. These mice have been modified to exhibit traits similar to the extinct woolly mammoth, such as long, woolly fur and a unique fat metabolism that helps them survive in cold environments. This breakthrough is part of a larger effort by Colossal Biosciences, a company dedicated to de-extinction, to eventually bring back the woolly mammoth. By studying the genetic differences between mammoths and their closest living relatives, Asian elephants, researchers have identified key genes responsible for the mammoth's distinctive features. The creation of woolly mice serves as a proof of concept, demonstrating that these genetic modifications can be successfully implemented. While the project has sparked debate about the ethical and ecological implications of de-extinction, it represents a significant step forward in the field of genetic engineering and conservation.
