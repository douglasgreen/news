### "Man with the Golden Arm": James Harrison, Who Saved Millions of Babies, Dies at 88

James Harrison, known as the "Man with the Golden Arm," has died peacefully at age 88 in a nursing home near Sydney, Australia. Harrison donated blood and plasma an incredible 1,173 times over six decades, saving more than 2 million babies' lives through his rare Anti-D antibody in his blood. After receiving blood transfusions during lung surgery at age 14, Harrison began donating at 18 and continued until he was 81, the maximum age allowed in Australia. His special antibody was used to make medication that prevents rhesus disease, a potentially fatal condition where a mother's blood attacks her unborn baby. Harrison's daughter Tracey said, "He was very proud to have saved so many lives without any cost or pain," adding that as an Anti-D recipient herself, "he has left behind a family that may not have existed without his precious donations."
