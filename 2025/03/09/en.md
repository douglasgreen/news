### Speaker Mike Johnson's Funding Bill Sparks Political Clash

House Speaker Mike Johnson has introduced a new funding bill to keep the government running until September 30, aiming to prevent a partial shutdown. The bill proposes $892.5 billion for defense and $708 billion for non-defense spending, which includes significant cuts from previous budgets. Despite backing from President Donald Trump, the bill faces strong opposition from Democrats, who argue it lacks protections for essential programs like Medicaid. Democratic leaders, including Rosa DeLauro and Patty Murray, have criticized the bill, warning that it could lead to a government shutdown if not amended. The bill is set for a vote next week, and its passage remains uncertain as both parties prepare for a potential showdown.

### US Blocks G7 Plan to Tackle Russia's Secret Oil Fleet

The United States recently vetoed a proposal by the Group of Seven (G7) to create a task force aimed at addressing Russia's "shadow fleet" of oil tankers. This fleet consists of old tankers that Russia uses to bypass Western sanctions imposed after its invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The proposal, led by Canada, sought to monitor and prevent sanctions evasion by these tankers. However, the US, under President Donald Trump's administration, is reassessing its role in international organizations and has softened its stance on Russia. This decision has led to tensions within the G7, as other member countries are keen on taking a firmer approach against Russia's actions. The US has also pushed for stronger language against China in the G7's maritime statement, highlighting risks in the South China Sea. The final G7 communiqué is still under negotiation and could change before the upcoming summit in Canada.

### Britain Considers New 'Four Eyes' Alliance Amidst U.S. Intelligence Sharing Concerns

In recent news, Britain has been urged to form a new intelligence-sharing alliance called the 'Four Eyes,' excluding the United States. This suggestion comes after President Donald Trump's decision to block the sharing of U.S.-generated classified information with Ukraine, a move that has raised concerns among allies. The 'Five Eyes' alliance, which includes the U.S., Britain, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, has been a cornerstone of intelligence cooperation. However, Trump's actions have led to discussions about creating a subgroup within this alliance that would allow intelligence sharing without U.S. involvement. This potential shift aims to ensure that vital intelligence can still be shared among trusted allies, particularly in light of ongoing tensions with Russia. The proposal reflects growing unease about the reliability of the U.S. as a partner under the current administration, prompting allies to consider alternative arrangements to safeguard their security interests.

### DHS Uses Polygraph Tests to Catch Information Leakers

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has started using polygraph tests to find employees who might be leaking sensitive information about immigration operations to the media. This decision comes after leaks reportedly affected the number of arrests by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and border czar Tom Homan have expressed concerns that these leaks are putting law enforcement lives at risk. The polygraph tests, which have been used in the past for screening new hires, are now being applied to employees across different agencies within DHS. The department aims to identify and prosecute those responsible for the leaks to ensure the safety and effectiveness of their operations.

### Romania's Presidential Race Takes a Dramatic Turn

In a surprising twist, Romania's central election authority has barred Calin Georgescu, a far-right pro-Russian candidate, from participating in the upcoming presidential election re-run scheduled for May. Georgescu, who had previously won the first round of the annulled election, is under criminal investigation for several charges, including promoting fascist organizations and spreading false information about campaign financing. His supporters, outraged by the decision, gathered outside the election bureau, demanding freedom and attempting to breach security. The annulment of the initial election was due to alleged Russian interference, a claim Moscow denies. The situation has drawn international attention, with figures like Elon Musk and members of Donald Trump's administration criticizing the decision as an attack on free speech. Despite the controversy, Romanian authorities maintain that the law must be applied impartially, regardless of political affiliations.

## Economy & Business

### Economic Uncertainty and Political Tensions Shape U.S. Landscape

In recent developments, the U.S. economy is experiencing a mix of challenges and uncertainties. The unemployment rate slightly increased to 4.1% in February, raising concerns about potential recession risks. Wall Street saw fluctuations, initially declining but later recovering, reflecting the market's response to these economic signals. President Trump's inconsistent tariff policies on Canadian and Mexican goods have added to the uncertainty, affecting businesses and trade relations. Economists are worried about the impact of these trade tensions on the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. Additionally, job growth in February was lower than expected, with non-farm payrolls increasing by only 151,000. The federal government's recent job cuts are anticipated to have a more pronounced effect in March. Meanwhile, political tensions are also evident, with Trump threatening further sanctions against Russia and distancing himself from mass federal worker firings linked to Elon Musk's cost-cutting measures. These developments highlight the complex interplay between economic indicators and political actions, shaping the current U.S. landscape.

### Mortgage Rates Drop: A New Hope for Homebuyers

Recently, mortgage rates have seen their largest weekly decline since mid-September, bringing them to the lowest level since December. This drop has sparked a surge in mortgage demand, with many potential buyers and homeowners considering refinancing. Experts are divided on whether now is the perfect time to buy, as the future of mortgage rates remains uncertain. While some believe that the current rates present a good opportunity for buyers, others caution that rates could continue to fluctuate due to economic factors like inflation and the Federal Reserve's policies. As the housing market adjusts, prospective buyers are advised to carefully evaluate their financial situation and consider the potential for future refinancing to take advantage of even lower rates.

### Global Protests Erupt Against Elon Musk and Tesla Amid Political Backlash

Protests against Elon Musk and Tesla have intensified worldwide, with demonstrators voicing their discontent over Musk's involvement with the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). In cities like New York, Boston, and Portland, protesters have gathered outside Tesla dealerships, chanting slogans such as "We need clean air, not another billionaire" and "Elon Musk has got to go." These protests have sometimes turned violent, with incidents of vandalism reported at Tesla locations, including fires at charging stations and gunshots damaging cars. The backlash is not limited to the United States; similar demonstrations have occurred in European cities like Barcelona, London, and Lisbon. Critics argue that Musk's policies threaten jobs and environmental standards, leading to a decline in Tesla's sales in regions like Germany and France. Despite the growing opposition, Musk has attributed the protests to external influences without providing specific evidence, further fueling the debate around his political and business influence.

### Hidden Commands in ESP32 Chip Raise Security Concerns

A recent discovery by Spanish researchers has unveiled a set of undocumented commands in the widely used ESP32 microchip, manufactured by Espressif. This chip, which provides WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity, is embedded in over a billion devices globally. The researchers, Miguel Tarascó Acuña and Antonio Vázquez Blanco from Tarlogic Security, presented their findings at RootedCON in Madrid. They identified 29 hidden commands within the chip's Bluetooth firmware, which could potentially be exploited for unauthorized access and device impersonation. These commands allow for low-level control over Bluetooth functions, including memory manipulation and MAC address spoofing. While Espressif has not documented these commands, the researchers warn that they could be used by malicious actors to conduct attacks on IoT devices, posing a significant security risk. Despite the alarming nature of these findings, some experts argue that such undocumented commands are common in hardware for debugging purposes and may not constitute a true "backdoor." Nonetheless, the discovery has sparked a debate about the security implications of undocumented features in widely used technology.

### State of Emergency Declared as Fierce Fires Sweep Through Long Island

On March 8, 2025, New York Governor Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency in Suffolk County as fierce brush fires swept through Long Island. The fires, driven by strong winds and dry conditions, began in the afternoon and quickly spread, engulfing large areas with thick smoke. Over 30 fire companies, along with the New York National Guard, were deployed to combat the blaze. Helicopters equipped with water buckets were used to douse the flames, while drones provided aerial monitoring. The fires led to the closure of major roads, including the Sunrise Highway, and prompted evacuations near the Francis S. Gabreski Air National Guard Base. Despite the challenging conditions, firefighters managed to contain a significant portion of the fires by evening. Governor Hochul urged residents to stay informed through emergency alerts and be prepared for possible evacuations as the situation evolved. The community's safety remained the top priority, with efforts continuing to prevent further spread and ensure the well-being of Long Islanders.

### America Loses a Fifth of Its Butterflies in Two Decades

In the past 20 years, the United States has seen a dramatic decline in its butterfly populations, with numbers dropping by 22%. This alarming trend, highlighted in a recent study published in the journal Science, reveals that one-third of butterfly species in the U.S. are experiencing significant declines. Factors such as climate change, habitat loss, and pesticide use are contributing to this decline, disrupting food sources and breeding cycles for these essential pollinators. The study emphasizes the importance of conservation efforts, suggesting that even small actions like planting native wildflowers and reducing pesticide use in backyards can help support butterfly populations. Despite the grim statistics, there is hope for recovery if urgent conservation measures are implemented, as butterflies have short generation times and can rebound quickly with the right support.

### Lift Weights, Sleep Tight: How Resistance Training Can Improve Your Rest

A recent study has revealed that resistance training, such as weightlifting, is an effective way to tire both the brain and body, leading to better sleep quality. This form of exercise not only strengthens muscles but also promotes brain health, making it particularly beneficial for older adults who struggle with insomnia. By engaging in resistance training, individuals can experience improved sleep patterns, as the physical exertion helps the body and mind relax more effectively. The study highlights that while all forms of exercise can aid sleep, resistance training stands out due to its ability to enhance muscle strength without the high intensity that might disrupt sleep. This makes it a suitable option for many, especially seniors, who need a safe and effective way to improve their sleep quality.

### Spring Forward: Embracing Longer Days with Daylight Saving Time

As the clocks jumped forward an hour early Sunday morning, many people across the United States welcomed the start of daylight saving time. This annual tradition, which began at 2 a.m. on March 9, 2025, marks the transition to longer daylight hours in the evenings, a change that many look forward to after the short days of winter. While digital clocks on devices like smartphones adjust automatically, many still had to manually set their analog clocks forward. Despite losing an hour of sleep, the promise of extended daylight in the evenings brings a sense of renewal and energy as spring approaches. However, the practice remains controversial, with some lawmakers pushing to make daylight saving time permanent, arguing that the biannual clock changes are unnecessary and disruptive. Until any legislative changes occur, Americans will continue to "spring forward" each March and "fall back" in November, adjusting their routines to make the most of the sunlight.
