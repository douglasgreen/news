### US Demands French Companies Follow Trump's Diversity Ban

In a recent move, the Trump administration has instructed French companies with U.S. government contracts to adhere to an executive order banning diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. This directive underscores the far-reaching influence of U.S. policies on European businesses. The companies received a questionnaire titled "Certification Regarding Compliance With Applicable Federal Anti-Discrimination Law," requiring them to confirm their compliance. This action has sparked concerns in Europe, as it challenges the region's secular approach to diversity, which focuses more on gender and socioeconomic background rather than race and ethnicity. The French Ministry of Foreign Trade has criticized the U.S. interference, labeling it as "unacceptable" and vowing to defend French businesses and values. This development adds to the ongoing economic and political tensions between the U.S. and Europe, fueled by Trump's "America First" policies.

### States Take Action: Banning Devices That Turn Pistols into Machine Guns

In recent years, a growing number of U.S. states have enacted laws to ban devices that convert pistols into machine guns, known as "Glock switches." These small devices, which can be easily attached to a pistol, allow the weapon to fire continuously with a single trigger pull, effectively turning it into a machine gun. This trend follows a decade-long increase in the use of such devices, which have been linked to a rise in gun violence. States like New Mexico and Alabama have taken bipartisan steps to outlaw these conversion devices, aligning with federal laws that have long prohibited machine guns and their conversion parts. The move aims to empower local law enforcement to tackle the issue more effectively and reduce the potential for mass shootings. Despite opposition from some gun-rights groups, who argue that existing federal laws are sufficient, the push for state-level bans continues to gain momentum as communities seek to enhance public safety.

### Ukraine Accuses Russia of War Crime After Hospital Attack

Ukraine's General Staff condemned the attack as a violation of international humanitarian law and vowed to present evidence to international criminal justice bodies. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for a strong response from Western allies, emphasizing the need for increased pressure on Russia to halt its aggressive actions. As the conflict continues, Ukraine remains steadfast in its efforts to defend its territory and seek justice for the victims of these attacks.

### Unveiling the Secrets of Tutankhamun's Osirian Rituals

In a groundbreaking study, Dr. Nicholas Brown, an Egyptologist from Yale University, has shed new light on the mysterious rituals associated with King Tutankhamun's burial. Hidden within the young pharaoh's tomb were clay trays and wooden staffs, initially overlooked as simple artifacts. Dr. Brown proposes that these items were integral to the "Awakening of Osiris" ritual, a ceremony believed to ensure the pharaoh's resurrection in the afterlife. The clay trays, made from Nile mud, likely held water used in libations, symbolizing purity and rebirth. Meanwhile, the wooden staffs may have played a role in ritually "waking" Tutankhamun, echoing the myth of Osiris being resurrected by staffs held behind his head. This discovery suggests that Tutankhamun might have been a pioneer of this ritual, which was previously thought to have originated later. The study not only highlights the spiritual significance of these objects but also underscores the rich tapestry of beliefs surrounding ancient Egyptian funerary practices.

### Pravda Network's Global Deception: AI Models Fooled by Fake News

In 2024, a Russian propaganda network named Pravda launched a massive disinformation campaign that successfully tricked AI models in 49 countries. The network published 3.6 million fake news articles, targeting AI systems rather than human readers. By flooding the internet with false narratives, Pravda aimed to manipulate AI chatbots and search engines into treating these lies as facts. A recent study revealed that 33% of responses from ten major AI chatbots included false Russian narratives, demonstrating the effectiveness of this strategy. The network operates over 150 fake news websites in multiple languages, making it difficult for AI models to distinguish between real and fake news. This manipulation poses a significant challenge as AI systems increasingly influence public opinion and decision-making worldwide.

### Earth Narrowly Escapes Solar Storm's Wrath

A massive solar storm recently erupted from the Sun, showcasing the star's immense power through stunning imagery of a solar flare and coronal mass ejection. Fortunately, most of the energy from this solar event did not head directly towards Earth, sparing us from severe impacts. However, the event did cause some radio blackouts, reminding us of the Sun's influence on our planet. The sunspot region AR4046, responsible for this activity, is expected to remain active for the next week. This means that if Earth and the Sun align more directly, we could experience effects like auroras and disruptions to communication systems. The recent solar flare was classified as an "X" event, the most intense level, highlighting the potential risks of solar activity. While the Earth dodged this solar storm, space experts continue to monitor the Sun closely, ensuring we are prepared for any future solar events.
