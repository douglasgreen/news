### US Military's Challenging Mission: Recovering a 70-Ton Vehicle and Finding Missing Soldiers in Lithuania

In a remote Lithuanian swamp, the US military is engaged in a complex operation to recover a 70-ton M88 Hercules armored recovery vehicle that sank during a training exercise. The vehicle, carrying four US Army soldiers from Fort Stewart, Georgia, disappeared early Tuesday near Pabradė. Despite the challenging terrain and thick mud, US Navy divers have successfully attached hoist lines to the vehicle to prevent it from sinking further. The soldiers remain missing, and search efforts continue with the help of Lithuanian forces using helicopters and ground teams. The area, similar to Alaska's swampy and forested environment, poses significant challenges, but hope remains as the search intensifies. Lithuanian Defense Minister Dovilė Šakalienė emphasized the country's commitment to finding the soldiers, considering them as their own. The US Army is keeping the soldiers' families informed, and the operation continues with determination and prayers for a positive outcome.

### Elon Musk's Million-Dollar Checks Stir Controversy in Wisconsin

In a surprising move, Elon Musk handed out $1 million checks to two voters in Wisconsin, sparking a heated debate just before a crucial state Supreme Court election. The Wisconsin Supreme Court had declined to intervene in a lawsuit aimed at stopping Musk's cash giveaways, which were seen by some as an attempt to influence the election. Musk, wearing a cheesehead hat, presented the checks during a rally in Green Bay, emphasizing the importance of the election for the future of civilization. Critics argue that Musk's actions could sway the court's ideological balance, affecting key issues like redistricting and voting rights. Despite the controversy, Musk insists that the payments are meant to generate grassroots support against activist judges, not to buy votes. The event has drawn national attention, highlighting the significant role of money in judicial elections.

### Key Election Battles in Wisconsin and Florida Signal Political Shifts

In recent elections, both Wisconsin and Florida have been at the forefront of political attention. In Florida, special elections were held in the 1st and 6th Congressional Districts to fill vacant seats. Historically Republican strongholds, these districts saw Republican candidates Jimmy Patronis and Randy Fine face off against Democrats Gay Valimont and Josh Weil. Despite the Republican advantage in voter registration, early voting showed a surprising uptick in Democratic participation. Meanwhile, Wisconsin's spring election featured a high-stakes race for the state Supreme Court between Susan Crawford, backed by Democrats, and Brad Schimel, supported by Republicans. This election, marked by significant campaign spending, is seen as a barometer for the state's political climate. Additionally, the race for state superintendent of public instruction and a photo ID amendment were on the ballot. Both states relied on the Associated Press for timely vote reporting, with recounts triggered in Florida due to narrow margins. These elections not only highlight the dynamic political landscapes in these states but also reflect broader national trends as both parties vie for influence.

### Aid Cuts Hinder U.S. Response to Myanmar Earthquake

In the wake of a devastating 7.7-magnitude earthquake in Myanmar, the international community has rallied to provide aid, with countries like China and Russia sending emergency response teams. However, the United States, once a leader in foreign aid, has been notably slow to act due to significant cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) under President Trump's administration. These cuts have left the U.S. aid system in disarray, lacking the resources and personnel needed for a swift response. While President Trump has stated that the U.S. will help, the reality on the ground is that the reduced capacity of USAID is hampering efforts to deliver timely assistance to the affected areas. This delay contrasts sharply with the rapid response from other nations and highlights the challenges faced by the U.S. in maintaining its role as a global leader in humanitarian aid.

### Marine Le Pen's Ban from 2027 Race Shakes French Politics

Marine Le Pen, a prominent far-right leader in France, has been banned from running for public office for five years, causing a significant stir in French politics. This decision came after she was found guilty of embezzling European funds to support her National Rally party. Le Pen, who was a strong contender for the 2027 presidential election, has criticized the ruling as a "political decision" and plans to appeal. Her ban has left her party in disarray, as they now need to find a new candidate for the upcoming election. The ruling has sparked debates across the political spectrum, with some viewing it as a blow to democracy, while others see it as a necessary action against corruption. As the situation unfolds, the future of the National Rally and its influence in French politics remains uncertain.

The incident has prompted a federal investigation involving the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Republican Party officials have expressed their determination to continue their work despite the attack, while local and state leaders, including Albuquerque's mayor and New Mexico's governor, have condemned the act of violence. This event is part of a troubling trend of politically motivated violence, with recent similar attacks targeting Tesla dealerships across the country. The investigation is ongoing, and authorities are urging anyone with information to come forward.

### Federal Review of Harvard's Funding Amid Antisemitism Concerns

The Trump administration has launched a comprehensive review of Harvard University's federal funding due to concerns about antisemitism on campus. This review involves examining nearly $9 billion in contracts and grants between Harvard and the federal government. The administration's task force aims to ensure that Harvard complies with civil rights laws and addresses antisemitic discrimination. This move follows similar actions taken against Columbia University, where funding was paused until the university agreed to certain demands. The review is part of a broader effort to combat antisemitism in higher education, with the administration emphasizing the importance of protecting students and promoting free inquiry. Harvard has yet to respond to these developments, which have sparked a national conversation about the balance between free speech and discrimination on college campuses.

### Joyful Celebrations Mark Eid al-Fitr Around the World

As the holy month of Ramadan comes to an end, Muslims worldwide are preparing to celebrate Eid al-Fitr, a festival that marks the conclusion of a month-long fast. This joyous occasion is filled with communal prayers, feasting, and the exchange of gifts. In many countries, families gather for special meals, often featuring traditional dishes and sweets. New clothes are worn, and homes are decorated to welcome friends and relatives. In Indonesia, the tradition of "mudik" sees people traveling back to their hometowns to celebrate with loved ones. Similarly, in Egypt, children receive cash gifts known as "eidiya," and families visit the graves of relatives to pay their respects. Despite regional differences, the spirit of Eid al-Fitr remains the same: a time for gratitude, generosity, and togetherness.

However, this vision has sparked concern among locals who fear the rise of Christian nationalism in their community.

### The Rise of the Torpedo Bat in Major League Baseball

In recent baseball news, a new bat design known as the "torpedo" bat is making waves across Major League Baseball (MLB).

### The Importance of Deep Sleep in Reducing Alzheimer's Risk

A recent study has highlighted the critical role of deep sleep in maintaining brain health and reducing the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Researchers found that insufficient time spent in deep sleep stages, such as slow-wave and REM sleep, can lead to the shrinkage of brain regions associated with cognitive functions. These changes may accelerate the onset of Alzheimer's disease. The study emphasizes that deep sleep helps the brain clear out toxins and consolidate memories, which are essential processes for cognitive health. Experts suggest that maintaining good sleep hygiene, such as having a regular sleep schedule and creating a restful sleep environment, can enhance deep sleep quality and potentially mitigate the risk of Alzheimer's. This research underscores the importance of prioritizing sleep as a modifiable lifestyle factor that can contribute to long-term brain health.
