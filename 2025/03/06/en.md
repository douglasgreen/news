### USDA Workers Return to Jobs After Mass Firing Reversed

Thousands of employees at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) are getting their jobs back after being fired by the Trump administration. A federal board found that the mass layoffs, which affected nearly 6,000 probationary workers, might have been illegal. These workers, who had been in their roles for about a year, were told they were not performing well enough to stay. However, the board's decision means they can return to work for at least 45 days while further investigations take place. This ruling challenges the Trump administration's efforts to reduce the federal workforce and could lead to more reinstatements in other government agencies. The situation remains uncertain, as the administration may still try to reduce staff numbers through other means.

### U.S. Tightens Visa Rules for Foreign Officials in Immigration Crackdown

The U.S. State Department has announced new visa restrictions targeting foreign officials who are believed to facilitate illegal immigration into the United States. This policy aims to hold accountable those officials, including immigration and customs officers, who fail to enforce immigration laws or create policies that allow illegal migration. The restrictions will apply to officials from countries along migratory routes to the U.S., particularly those who knowingly assist or fail to prevent illegal entry into the country. The move is part of a broader effort to secure U.S. borders and ensure national security by preventing illegal immigration. The policy also extends to certain family members of these officials, emphasizing the U.S. commitment to enforcing immigration laws and protecting its borders.

### Al Green Censured for Disrupting Trump's Speech

During a joint session of Congress, Democratic Representative Al Green was censured for interrupting President Donald Trump's address. Green, a long-serving congressman from Texas, stood up and shouted at Trump, accusing him of lacking a mandate, which led to his removal from the chamber. The House voted 224 to 198 in favor of the censure, with ten Democrats siding with Republicans. This formal reprimand, though not removing Green from office, marked a significant moment in congressional history. Green, unrepentant, defended his actions as a stand against what he described as Trump's incivility and plans to cut Medicaid, a vital program for many of his constituents. Despite the censure, Green vowed to continue speaking out against injustices, highlighting the ongoing tensions and partisan divides within Congress.

### US Charges 12 Chinese Hackers for Breaching Treasury Department

In a significant move, the United States has charged 12 Chinese nationals, including hackers and government officials, for their involvement in a major cybercrime campaign. These individuals are accused of hacking into various U.S. government agencies, including the Treasury Department, and stealing sensitive data. The hackers allegedly worked for a private company called I-Soon, which was paid by the Chinese government to target dissidents and other entities of interest. This operation is part of a broader hacking-for-hire ecosystem in China, where private contractors are used to conduct cyber espionage on behalf of the state. The charges highlight the ongoing cyber threats posed by state-sponsored hacking groups and the challenges in safeguarding national security. Despite the allegations, China has denied any involvement, calling the accusations baseless. The U.S. continues to strengthen its defenses against such cyber threats to protect its critical infrastructure and national interests.

### The End of an Era: Trump Halts Global Air Quality Monitoring

In a surprising move, President Trump has decided to shut down the U.S. State Department's worldwide air quality monitoring program. This program, which has been in place for over a decade, provided crucial data from 80 embassies and consulates around the globe. The information was not only vital for research but also helped foreign service officers determine if it was safe for their families to be outdoors. The decision to suspend the program was attributed to budget constraints, leaving many health officials and environmental experts concerned about the impact on Americans abroad. The program had previously led to significant improvements in air quality in countries like China, where U.S. embassy data revealed pollution levels that were worse than local reports. With the program's suspension, many fear a gap in reliable air quality data, especially in developing countries that relied heavily on the U.S. monitoring systems.

## Athena's Uncertain Moon Landing: A New Chapter in Space Exploration

A private spacecraft named Athena, built by Intuitive Machines, has successfully reached the moon's surface, but its exact status remains unclear. The lander, which aimed to touch down near the lunar south pole, is communicating with Earth and generating power, yet it may not be upright. This mission is significant as it marks the second U.S. private company to land on the moon this week, following Firefly Aerospace's successful landing. Athena's mission includes searching for water and testing new technologies, such as a rover and a drill designed to explore lunar soil.

## The Molecular Dance: Nature's Nonrepeating Patterns

In a fascinating twist of science, chemists have discovered a molecule that naturally forms nonrepeating patterns, echoing the mathematical marvel of the einstein tile. This molecule, when placed on a silver surface, arranges itself into unique triangular spirals that never repeat, much like the elusive einstein tile that can cover a plane without a repeating pattern. The secret lies in the molecule's ability to switch between mirror-image shapes and form weak bonds, allowing it to explore countless configurations. This discovery not only bridges the gap between chemistry and mathematics but also hints at new materials with extraordinary properties, as these nonrepeating patterns could lead to novel physical behaviors. This molecular dance showcases nature's ability to solve complex puzzles, offering a glimpse into the intricate beauty of the world at the molecular level.

### A Hidden Treasure in Our Cells: New Immune System Discovery Offers Hope for Antibiotics

Scientists have made an exciting discovery about the immune system that could lead to the development of new antibiotics. Researchers found that a part of the body known for recycling proteins, called the proteasome, has a hidden ability to produce chemicals that can kill bacteria. This discovery changes how we understand our body's defense against infections and offers a new way to find antibiotics to fight superbugs that resist current drugs. The proteasome, present in every cell, usually breaks down old proteins, but when it detects bacteria, it transforms these proteins into weapons that can destroy the bacteria. This breakthrough, discovered by a team in Israel, has been tested in labs and on mice, showing promising results similar to existing antibiotics. While more testing is needed, this finding provides hope for tackling the growing problem of drug-resistant infections.

### Discovery of Earth's Oldest Impact Crater in Western Australia

In the remote Pilbara region of Western Australia, scientists have discovered what is believed to be the world's oldest-known impact crater, dating back 3.47 billion years. This ancient crater, named the North Pole Crater, was likely formed by a massive meteorite impact that left a significant mark on Earth's early history. The crater, originally about 100 kilometers wide, now features a central raised area known as the North Pole Dome. This discovery provides a unique glimpse into the early conditions of our planet and may offer clues about the origins of life. The presence of shatter cones, which are unique geological formations created by high-pressure impacts, confirms the site's status as an impact crater. This finding opens new avenues for studying Earth's geological past and understanding the role of meteorite impacts in shaping the planet's surface and possibly influencing the emergence of life.
