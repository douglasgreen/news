### Tensions Rise at G7 as Rubio Faces Backlash Over Trump's Policies

At the G7 summit in Canada, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio encountered a chilly reception from America's closest allies. The meeting was overshadowed by President Donald Trump's controversial policies, including his proposal to annex Canada as the 51st state. This idea, along with newly imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum, has strained relations with Canada and other G7 members. Canadian Foreign Minister MÃ©lanie Joly expressed her country's frustration, emphasizing the need to address these tariffs and Trump's rhetoric. Despite the tension, Rubio insisted that the summit's focus would remain on global issues like the Ukraine conflict, rather than Trump's contentious proposals. The atmosphere at the summit highlighted the growing divide between the U.S. and its traditional allies, as they grapple with the implications of Trump's "America First" agenda.

## Putin's Surprise Visit to Kursk Amidst Ceasefire Talks

In a surprising move, Russian President Vladimir Putin visited the Kursk region, where Russian forces are engaged in intense battles with Ukrainian troops. This visit marks Putin's first trip to Kursk since Ukraine's unexpected incursion last year. Dressed in military fatigues, Putin addressed the troops, emphasizing the need for a swift victory to "liberate" the region. His visit comes at a critical time as the United States, led by President Donald Trump, has proposed a 30-day ceasefire, which Ukraine has accepted. However, the decision now rests with Russia, as Trump stated that achieving peace is "up to Russia now." The Kremlin is reportedly studying the proposal, while Putin's visit seems to signal a strong stance against the ceasefire, urging his military to continue their efforts in Kursk. As the world watches, the outcome of these developments could significantly impact the ongoing conflict and the potential for peace in the region.

### Walmart Faces Challenges in China Over Tariff Disputes

Walmart is currently facing significant challenges in China due to the ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China. The U.S. retail giant has been caught in the middle of a trade war after President Trump imposed a 20% tariff on Chinese imports.

This move has not been well-received by Chinese authorities, who have summoned Walmart executives to discuss the issue. The Chinese government views Walmart's demands as unfair and potentially harmful to international trade relations. As a result, there is a risk of further actions from China if Walmart continues to pressure its suppliers. This situation highlights the broader impact of geopolitical tensions on global supply chains and the challenges faced by multinational companies operating in multiple countries.

## The Blood Moon: A Celestial Spectacle in the Night Sky

On the night of March 13, 2025, a breathtaking celestial event will unfold as the Earth positions itself between the sun and the moon, creating a total lunar eclipse known as the "Blood Moon." This phenomenon will be visible across North and South America, parts of Africa, the Pacific, and Europe. As the Earth's shadow envelops the moon, it will take on a striking reddish hue, a result of sunlight filtering through the Earth's atmosphere. This captivating transformation occurs because the shorter blue wavelengths of light scatter, leaving the longer red wavelengths to illuminate the moon. The event will begin late in the evening and reach totality in the early hours of March 14, offering skywatchers a chance to witness this rare and beautiful spectacle. No special equipment is needed to enjoy the view, but a clear, dark sky will enhance the experience. For those unable to see it in person, online streams will provide a virtual glimpse of this awe-inspiring event.

### The Ocean's Hidden Wonders: New Marine Species Discovered

In a groundbreaking exploration of Earth's vast oceans, scientists have uncovered 866 new marine species, revealing the ocean's hidden wonders. Among these discoveries are the guitar shark, named for its unique shape resembling the musical instrument, and a venomous snail with harpoon-like teeth. This ambitious project, known as the Ocean Census, involved a global alliance of scientists who spent 16 months exploring the depths of the ocean using advanced technology like submersibles and remotely operated vehicles. The findings highlight the immense biodiversity of marine life, with only an estimated 10% of species currently known to science. This mission not only expands our understanding of ocean ecosystems but also emphasizes the importance of protecting these newly discovered species and their habitats. As the Ocean Census continues, it aims to identify 100,000 new species over the next decade, transforming our approach to marine science and conservation.
