### EU Strikes Back with $28 Billion Tariffs on U.S. Goods

The European Union has announced a significant move to impose counter tariffs on $28 billion worth of U.S. goods. This decision comes as a response to the U.S. increasing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Starting next month, the EU will target a wide range of American products, including industrial and agricultural goods such as steel, aluminum, textiles, and various food items. The EU aims to match the economic impact of the U.S. tariffs with these measures. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that the EU is open to dialogue and has tasked Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic with seeking better solutions with the U.S. This development marks a new chapter in the ongoing trade tensions between the two economic giants.

### Greenland's Election: A Step Towards Independence Amid Global Tensions

In a significant election, Greenland's opposition party, Demokraatit, emerged victorious, capturing 29.9% of the vote. This election was closely watched due to U.S. President Donald Trump's controversial remarks about annexing the island. The election highlighted Greenland's desire for independence from Denmark, though the winning party advocates for a gradual approach. The island, rich in resources and strategically located in the Arctic, has become a focal point for global powers like the U.S., Russia, and China. Despite Trump's interest, a majority of Greenlanders oppose becoming part of the U.S., fearing it could threaten their welfare systems and cultural identity. The election results reflect a cautious but determined step towards self-governance, as Greenland navigates its future amidst international pressures.

### House Republicans Pass Funding Bill with Trump and Vance's Influence

In a dramatic turn of events, House Republicans successfully passed a stopgap funding bill to keep the government running, narrowly avoiding a shutdown. The bill, which maintains current funding levels until September 30, was passed with a 217-213 vote. This was largely due to the efforts of President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, who campaigned vigorously to secure support from hesitant Republicans. The bill increases defense spending by $8 billion while cutting non-defense spending by $13 billion. Despite opposition from most Democrats, one Democrat, Rep. Jared Golden, voted in favor, tipping the scales. The bill now moves to the Senate, where it faces further challenges. This legislative victory highlights the influence of Trump and Vance in rallying support for critical government funding measures.

### Kentucky's Political Drama: A Headache for Trump

In Kentucky, a political storm is brewing as Representative Thomas Massie stands firm against a government funding bill backed by former President Donald Trump. Massie, known for his independent streak, has refused to support the bill, arguing it doesn't address necessary budget cuts. This has led Trump to call for Massie's removal from office, comparing him to Liz Cheney, another Republican who faced backlash for opposing Trump. Despite Trump's criticism, Massie has garnered support from various Republican and Libertarian figures who admire his principled stance and thorough approach to legislation. The situation highlights the tension within the Republican Party, as Trump's influence is challenged by lawmakers like Massie who prioritize fiscal responsibility over party allegiance. As the government faces a potential shutdown, all eyes are on Kentucky to see how this political drama unfolds.

### Trump’s ICE Says Biden Hid the Truth About Arrests

In March 2025, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) under President Trump announced that they made more arrests of illegal immigrants in just a few weeks than the Biden administration did in all of 2024. ICE leaders accused Biden’s team of “cooking the books,” meaning they lied about the numbers by counting people who were caught and let go as real arrests. Trump’s ICE says they are now doing things right, arresting over 32,000 people since January 20, including many criminals and gang members. They promise to keep pushing hard to deport people who broke immigration laws, saying Biden’s way was weak and dishonest.

### Inflation Eases to 2.8% in February, Offering a Glimmer of Hope

In February, the inflation rate in the United States cooled to 2.8%, which was lower than many economists had expected. This decline marks a positive shift from January's 3% rate, providing some relief to consumers and businesses alike. The decrease was partly due to stable grocery prices and a drop in gas prices, which helped ease the financial burden on households. However, experts warn that this progress might be temporary, as ongoing trade tensions and tariffs introduced by President Trump could lead to future price increases. Despite these concerns, the current slowdown in inflation is a welcome development, suggesting that the efforts to stabilize the economy are beginning to show results.

### Trump Buys a Tesla at the White House to Support Elon Musk Amidst Stock Slump

In a surprising move, President Donald Trump purchased a Tesla Model S at the White House to show his support for Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX. This event took place on the South Lawn, where Trump and Musk were seen examining several Tesla vehicles. Trump's decision to buy the car was a gesture to boost Tesla's image and sales, which have been struggling recently due to declining stock prices and protests against the company. Despite the unusual nature of a sitting president publicly backing a private company, Trump expressed his admiration for Musk's contributions to the American economy and innovation. The purchase was also seen as a way to counteract the negative impact on Tesla's stock and to support Musk, who has been a key figure in Trump's administration. However, this act raised questions about the ethical implications of a president promoting a private business, especially one led by a close adviser.

### Southwest Airlines Ends Free Checked Bags Policy After 54 Years

### Developer's Revenge: The Code That Crashed a Company

Davis Lu, a 55-year-old software developer, was sentenced to up to 10 years in prison for creating and deploying malicious code that severely disrupted his former employer's operations. After working for Eaton Corp. for 11 years, Lu became unhappy when his role was reduced during a company restructuring in 2018. In retaliation, he wrote harmful code that deleted important files, blocked logins, and caused system failures.

## Discovery of 'Pink': The Oldest Human Face Fossil in Western Europe

In a remarkable discovery, archaeologists in Spain have uncovered the oldest known partial face fossil of a human ancestor in Western Europe. The fossil, affectionately nicknamed "Pink," was found at the Sima del Elefante site in the Atapuerca Mountains. Dating back between 1.1 and 1.4 million years, Pink's remains consist of a left cheekbone and upper jaw. This discovery sheds light on early human migration patterns, suggesting that ancient humans settled in Europe much earlier than previously thought. Researchers believe Pink may belong to a new species closely related to Homo erectus, a species known for its use of tools and fire. The site also revealed stone tools and animal bones, indicating that these early humans were skilled hunters. This finding not only enriches our understanding of human evolution but also highlights the rich prehistoric history of the Atapuerca region.

However, the new research suggests that the health benefits of red wine might not be as significant as once thought, with some exceptions. While red wine does contain more beneficial compounds than white wine, the overall health impact is not as clear-cut. The study emphasizes that moderate consumption of any wine can be part of a healthy lifestyle, but it is crucial to avoid excessive drinking due to the potential negative health effects. This finding encourages wine lovers to enjoy their preferred choice, whether red or white, in moderation.
