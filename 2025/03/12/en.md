### EU Strikes Back with $28 Billion Tariffs on U.S. Goods

The European Union has announced a significant move to impose counter tariffs on $28 billion worth of U.S. goods. This decision comes as a response to the U.S. increasing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Starting next month, the EU will target a wide range of American products, including industrial and agricultural goods such as steel, aluminum, textiles, and various food items. The EU aims to match the economic impact of the U.S. tariffs with these measures. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that the EU is open to dialogue and has tasked Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic with seeking better solutions with the U.S. This development marks a new chapter in the ongoing trade tensions between the two economic giants.

### Greenland's Election: A Step Towards Independence Amid Global Tensions

In a significant election, Greenland's opposition party, Demokraatit, emerged victorious, capturing 29.9% of the vote. This election was closely watched due to U.S. President Donald Trump's controversial remarks about annexing the island. The election highlighted Greenland's desire for independence from Denmark, though the winning party advocates for a gradual approach. The island, rich in resources and strategically located in the Arctic, has become a focal point for global powers like the U.S., Russia, and China. Despite Trump's interest, a majority of Greenlanders oppose becoming part of the U.S., fearing it could threaten their welfare systems and cultural identity. The election results reflect a cautious but determined step towards self-governance, as Greenland navigates its future amidst international pressures.

### House Republicans Pass Funding Bill with Trump and Vance's Influence

In a dramatic turn of events, House Republicans successfully passed a stopgap funding bill to keep the government running, narrowly avoiding a shutdown. The bill, which maintains current funding levels until September 30, was passed with a 217-213 vote. This was largely due to the efforts of President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, who campaigned vigorously to secure support from hesitant Republicans. The bill increases defense spending by $8 billion while cutting non-defense spending by $13 billion. Despite opposition from most Democrats, one Democrat, Rep. Jared Golden, voted in favor, tipping the scales. The bill now moves to the Senate, where it faces further challenges. This legislative victory highlights the influence of Trump and Vance in rallying support for critical government funding measures.

### Kentucky's Political Drama: A Headache for Trump

In Kentucky, a political storm is brewing as Representative Thomas Massie stands firm against a government funding bill backed by former President Donald Trump. Massie, known for his independent streak, has refused to support the bill, arguing it doesn't address necessary budget cuts. This has led Trump to call for Massie's removal from office, comparing him to Liz Cheney, another Republican who faced backlash for opposing Trump. Despite Trump's criticism, Massie has garnered support from various Republican and Libertarian figures who admire his principled stance and thorough approach to legislation. The situation highlights the tension within the Republican Party, as Trump's influence is challenged by lawmakers like Massie who prioritize fiscal responsibility over party allegiance. As the government faces a potential shutdown, all eyes are on Kentucky to see how this political drama unfolds.

### Trump Buys a Tesla at the White House to Support Elon Musk Amidst Stock Slump

In a surprising move, President Donald Trump purchased a Tesla Model S at the White House to show his support for Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX. This event took place on the South Lawn, where Trump and Musk were seen examining several Tesla vehicles. Trump's decision to buy the car was a gesture to boost Tesla's image and sales, which have been struggling recently due to declining stock prices and protests against the company. Despite the unusual nature of a sitting president publicly backing a private company, Trump expressed his admiration for Musk's contributions to the American economy and innovation. The purchase was also seen as a way to counteract the negative impact on Tesla's stock and to support Musk, who has been a key figure in Trump's administration. However, this act raised questions about the ethical implications of a president promoting a private business, especially one led by a close adviser.

### NASA's New Missions to Explore the Sun and the Universe's Origins

NASA has successfully launched two groundbreaking missions, SPHEREx and PUNCH, to explore the mysteries of the universe and the Sun. SPHEREx, short for Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization and Ices Explorer, aims to map the entire sky in infrared light, providing insights into the origins of the universe and the formation of galaxies. It will also search for life's essential ingredients, like water and carbon dioxide, in our galaxy. Meanwhile, the PUNCH mission, consisting of four small satellites, will study the Sun's outer atmosphere, known as the corona, to understand how it transforms into the solar wind. This mission will help scientists predict space weather events that can impact Earth and technology. Both missions launched aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, marking a significant step forward in our quest to understand the cosmos and our place within it.

### Uranus: The Mysterious Heat of the Ice Giant

Uranus, the seventh planet from the Sun, has always intrigued scientists with its unique characteristics. Recently, researchers discovered that Uranus emits more heat than previously thought. This finding is surprising because Uranus is known for its low internal heat compared to other giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn. Unlike its neighbors, which radiate almost twice as much energy as they receive from the Sun, Uranus was believed to emit very little excess heat. However, new observations suggest that Uranus might have hidden sources of heat, possibly due to its complex interior structure or unknown atmospheric processes. This discovery challenges our understanding of the ice giant and opens up new questions about its formation and evolution in the solar system.

### Only Seven Countries Breathe Clean Air, Study Reveals

A recent study has highlighted a concerning global issue: only seven countries worldwide meet the World Health Organization's (WHO) air quality guidelines. These countries include Australia, New Zealand, Estonia, Iceland, and a few small island nations. The study, conducted by IQAir, focused on the levels of PM2.5, tiny toxic particles that can harm human health. Most countries, including major economies like the United States and Canada, exceed the recommended levels, posing significant health risks. The report emphasizes the urgent need for global action to improve air quality, as dirty air is a leading cause of health problems worldwide. Despite some progress in countries like India and China, where pollution levels have slightly decreased, the overall picture remains grim. The study calls for increased efforts to reduce pollution through renewable energy, better urban planning, and stricter emissions controls.

## NIH Cuts Vaccine Hesitancy Research Amid Measles Outbreak Concerns

In a surprising move, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has decided to terminate or reduce funding for over 40 research grants focused on understanding vaccine hesitancy and improving vaccine uptake. This decision comes at a critical time when the United States is experiencing a significant measles outbreak, with over 200 cases reported across multiple states. The cuts have raised concerns among public health experts who emphasize the importance of understanding why some individuals are reluctant to vaccinate. They argue that such research is crucial for developing strategies to increase vaccination rates and prevent outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. The decision aligns with the views of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the new Health and Human Services Secretary, known for his skepticism towards vaccines. As the nation grapples with the measles outbreak, many worry that halting this research could hinder efforts to address vaccine hesitancy and protect public health.
