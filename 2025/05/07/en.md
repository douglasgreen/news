### Friedrich Merz Elected German Chancellor After Historic Parliamentary Standoff

Friedrich Merz has officially become Germany’s 10th postwar chancellor, but his ascent was anything but smooth. In a dramatic turn of events on May 6, Merz failed to secure the required majority in the Bundestag's first vote—a first in the history of the Federal Republic. Despite his CDU/CSU and SPD coalition holding 328 seats, Merz garnered only 310 votes, falling six short of the 316 needed. This unexpected setback exposed internal fractures within the coalition and raised concerns about the stability of his leadership.

A second vote held later that day saw Merz narrowly clinch the chancellorship with 325 votes. The initial failure, attributed to at least 18 coalition members voting against him in a secret ballot, has emboldened the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), now the second-largest party in the Bundestag. The AfD capitalized on the turmoil, calling for new elections and questioning the legitimacy of Merz's government.

Undeterred, Chancellor Merz embarked on his first diplomatic visits to Paris and Warsaw, signaling a commitment to European unity and defense collaboration. In meetings with French President Emmanuel Macron and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, Merz emphasized the importance of strengthening EU ties and reducing reliance on external powers. Domestically, he faces the daunting task of navigating a fragile coalition, addressing economic challenges, and countering the rising influence of the far-right.

### Fed Holds Rates Steady Amid Tariff-Driven Economic Uncertainty

On May 7, 2025, the Federal Reserve announced its decision to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 4.25% to 4.5%, marking the third consecutive meeting without a change. This move reflects the central bank's cautious approach in the face of escalating trade tensions and economic uncertainties, particularly stemming from President Donald Trump's recent tariff policies. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the need for flexibility, stating that while the economy remains solid, the full impact of the tariffs is still unfolding.

The newly imposed tariffs—10% on a broad range of imports and a significant 145% on Chinese goods—have raised concerns about potential stagflation, a scenario characterized by rising inflation and slowing growth. Although inflation dipped to 2.4% in March and April's job growth exceeded expectations, these figures may not yet capture the tariffs' long-term effects. Powell acknowledged the heightened risks, noting that the central bank is prepared to adjust its policies as more data becomes available.

Financial markets responded with cautious optimism; the S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted modest gains, while bond yields declined. However, the probability of a rate cut in June has decreased, with market expectations now leaning towards potential adjustments in July or later. The Fed's decision underscores its commitment to data-driven policymaking, balancing the dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and stabilizing prices amid an increasingly complex economic landscape.

### Three Former Memphis Officers Acquitted in Tyre Nichols' Death Amid National Outcry

On May 7, 2025, a Tennessee jury acquitted three former Memphis police officers—Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, and Justin Smith—of all state charges, including second-degree murder, in the 2023 beating death of Tyre Nichols. Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man, died three days after a violent encounter with police during a traffic stop. The incident, captured on video, showed officers repeatedly striking Nichols, sparking nationwide protests and calls for police reform.

The jury, drawn from a majority-white county, deliberated for over eight hours following a nine-day trial before delivering the unanimous not-guilty verdict. Defense attorneys argued that the officers were following protocol and placed blame on another officer, Emmitt Martin, who had previously pleaded guilty. Prosecutors contended that the three failed to intervene or provide aid to Nichols.

Despite the state acquittals, all three officers have been convicted on federal charges related to the incident. Haley was found guilty of violating Nichols' civil rights, obstruction of justice, and conspiracy, while Bean and Smith were convicted of witness tampering. Sentencing for these federal convictions is pending. The Nichols family has condemned the state verdict as a "devastating miscarriage of justice" and is pursuing a $550 million civil lawsuit against the officers, the city of Memphis, and the police chief.

### Black Smoke Rises: No Pope Elected in First Vote of 2025 Conclave

On Wednesday evening, May 7, 2025, black smoke billowed from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel, signaling that the College of Cardinals has not yet elected a new pope. This traditional signal followed the first round of voting in the papal conclave, convened to choose a successor to Pope Francis, who passed away on April 21 at the age of 88. The 133 cardinal electors, representing 70 countries, will reconvene on Thursday for additional voting sessions .

The day's proceedings began with a solemn procession into the Sistine Chapel, where the cardinals took oaths of secrecy and participated in the centuries-old ritual of papal selection. The emergence of black smoke at 9:00 p.m. local time indicated that no candidate achieved the required two-thirds majority, or 89 votes, necessary for election. Among the leading contenders are Italian Cardinal Pietro Parolin and Filipino Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle, though no clear frontrunner has emerged .

Outside, thousands gathered in St. Peter’s Square, braving the evening chill in anticipation of the smoke signal. The diverse composition of the College of Cardinals, with increased representation from Asia, Africa, and Latin America, reflects Pope Francis's efforts to globalize the Church's leadership. As the conclave continues, the world watches closely for the white smoke that will announce the election of the 267th pope .

### Utah's NHL Team Officially Becomes the Utah Mammoth After Yearlong Fan Vote

After more than a year of anticipation and over 850,000 fan votes, Utah's NHL franchise has officially adopted the name "Utah Mammoth." The announcement was made on May 7, 2025, by team owners Ryan and Ashley Smith, marking the culmination of a community-driven naming process that began following the team's relocation from Arizona in 2024. The name pays homage to the Ice Age mammoths that once roamed the region over 10,000 years ago, symbolizing strength and resilience.

The newly unveiled logo features a mammoth head with snow-capped peaks forming the top, representing the Wasatch Mountains, and a tusk shaped like a "U" for Utah. Additional design elements include a silhouette of the state and a hidden "M" within the logo. The team's rallying cry, "Tusks Up," encapsulates the spirit and unity of the franchise and its supporters.

The Utah Mammoth will retain the color scheme of mountain blue, rock black, and salt white, which became synonymous with the team during its inaugural season as the Utah Hockey Club. With the fourth pick in the upcoming NHL draft and significant salary cap space, the Mammoth are poised to build a competitive roster. General Manager Bill Armstrong and the team's leadership are focused on assembling a squad that embodies the strength and momentum symbolized by their new name.

### T. rex's Asian Roots: Study Reveals Ancestors Migrated to North America via Land Bridge

A recent study led by researchers at University College London has unveiled that the direct ancestors of Tyrannosaurus rex likely migrated from Asia to North America over 70 million years ago. Utilizing mathematical modeling that incorporated fossil records, evolutionary trees, and paleoclimate data, the team concluded that these ancestors crossed the Bering Land Bridge—connecting present-day Siberia and Alaska—during the Late Cretaceous period. This migration aligns with previous findings that T. rex shares a closer genetic relationship with Asian tyrannosaurids like Tarbosaurus than with North American counterparts such as Daspletosaurus.

The study, published in Royal Society Open Science, also observed that the rapid growth in size of tyrannosaurids, including T. rex, coincided with a global cooling event following a peak in temperatures around 92 million years ago. This suggests that these dinosaurs may have been better adapted to cooler climates, potentially due to physiological traits like feathers or warm-bloodedness.

Lead author Cassius Morrison noted that while numerous T. rex fossils have been discovered in North America, their direct ancestors' remains may still lie undiscovered in Asia. The findings not only shed light on the migratory patterns of these prehistoric predators but also open avenues for future fossil discoveries in unexplored Asian regions.

### New Study Links Early COVID-19 Spread to Wildlife Trade, Not Direct Bat Transmission

A recent study published in Cell by researchers from UC San Diego and international collaborators suggests that the initial spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, was likely facilitated by the wildlife trade rather than direct transmission from bats to humans. The study indicates that the virus arrived in Wuhan too rapidly for bats to have carried it naturally, pointing instead to human-mediated transportation through the wildlife trade as a more plausible route.

The research draws parallels between the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and the 2002 SARS outbreak, both of which appear to have been amplified by the wildlife trade. By analyzing the evolutionary patterns of bat coronaviruses, the scientists found that the dispersal of SARS-CoV-2 aligns with the movement of wildlife species commonly involved in trade, rather than with the natural migration patterns of bats.

These findings underscore the significant role that the wildlife trade may play in the emergence of zoonotic diseases. The study advocates for stricter regulations and monitoring of wildlife markets to mitigate the risk of future pandemics originating from similar pathways. As the global community continues to investigate the origins of COVID-19, this research adds weight to the argument that human activities, particularly the wildlife trade, are critical factors in the spillover of viruses from animals to humans.
