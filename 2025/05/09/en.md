### India Launches Airstrikes on Pakistan Following Kashmir Attack; Islamabad Vows Retaliation

Tensions between India and Pakistan have escalated dramatically after India conducted airstrikes on Pakistani territory in response to a deadly terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir. On May 7, 2025, India initiated "Operation Sindoor," targeting nine sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, which it identified as terrorist infrastructure linked to groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed. These strikes were a direct retaliation for the April 22 attack in Pahalgam, where 26 Indian tourists were killed. India asserts that the operation was a precise, non-escalatory measure aimed at neutralizing terrorist threats. 

Pakistan has condemned the airstrikes, reporting that they resulted in at least 31 civilian deaths, including children, and damaged civilian infrastructure such as mosques. In response, Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif authorized a military retaliation, with the army claiming to have shot down five Indian fighter jets and launched attacks on Indian military positions. The Pakistani military has also reported intercepting multiple Indian drones and missiles. 

The international community has expressed deep concern over the escalating conflict between the two nuclear-armed nations. While the United States has called for restraint, Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have taken more active roles in mediating the crisis, urging both sides to de-escalate tensions. Despite these efforts, the situation remains volatile, with ongoing cross-border shelling and drone incursions raising fears of a broader conflict.
