### India Launches Airstrikes on Pakistan Following Kashmir Attack; Islamabad Vows Retaliation

Tensions between India and Pakistan have escalated dramatically after India conducted airstrikes on Pakistani territory in response to a deadly terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir. On May 7, 2025, India initiated "Operation Sindoor," targeting nine sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, which it identified as terrorist infrastructure linked to groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed. These strikes were a direct retaliation for the April 22 attack in Pahalgam, where 26 Indian tourists were killed. India asserts that the operation was a precise, non-escalatory measure aimed at neutralizing terrorist threats. 

Pakistan has condemned the airstrikes, reporting that they resulted in at least 31 civilian deaths, including children, and damaged civilian infrastructure such as mosques. In response, Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif authorized a military retaliation, with the army claiming to have shot down five Indian fighter jets and launched attacks on Indian military positions. The Pakistani military has also reported intercepting multiple Indian drones and missiles. 

The international community has expressed deep concern over the escalating conflict between the two nuclear-armed nations. While the United States has called for restraint, Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have taken more active roles in mediating the crisis, urging both sides to de-escalate tensions. Despite these efforts, the situation remains volatile, with ongoing cross-border shelling and drone incursions raising fears of a broader conflict.

### Wall Street Ends Volatile Week Lower as U.S.-China Trade Talks Loom

U.S. stock markets concluded a turbulent week with modest losses on Friday, as investors remained cautious ahead of pivotal trade discussions between the United States and China. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined by 0.3%, the S&P 500 slipped 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite ended nearly unchanged. This subdued finish followed weeks of significant volatility driven by uncertainties surrounding President Donald Trump's tariff policies and their implications for global trade. 

Investor sentiment was influenced by President Trump's recent proposal to reduce tariffs on Chinese imports from 145% to 80%, a move that briefly buoyed markets but failed to sustain momentum. The upcoming trade talks in Switzerland, involving U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and China's Vice Premier He Lifeng, are anticipated to address these tariff concerns. Despite the potential for easing tensions, market participants remained wary, with the S&P 500 stalling near a resistance level after a significant rally. 

Corporate earnings also played a role in market dynamics. Companies like Lyft and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing reported strong earnings, leading to notable stock gains, while others like Expedia faced declines due to softer demand. As investors look ahead, the outcomes of the U.S.-China trade talks and signals from the Federal Reserve regarding interest rates are expected to be key determinants of market direction in the coming weeks.

### AI 'Resurrects' Arizona Road Rage Victim to Address Killer in Courtroom First

In a groundbreaking moment for the U.S. legal system, an Arizona courtroom witnessed a deceased man addressing his killer through an AI-generated video. Christopher Pelkey, a 37-year-old Army veteran fatally shot during a 2021 road rage incident in Chandler, was digitally recreated to deliver a victim impact statement at the sentencing of Gabriel Paul Horcasitas. The video, crafted by Pelkey's sister, Stacey Wales, and her husband using AI technology, featured Pelkey's likeness and voice expressing forgiveness and empathy towards Horcasitas, stating, "In another life, we probably could have been friends".

The AI-generated video, based on a script by Pelkey’s sister and created using modified images and voice mimicking, showed Pelkey expressing forgiveness and advocating love and appreciation for life. Judge Todd Lang described the AI statement as reflective of Pelkey's character and family values. While AI is increasingly used in court administration, its use as a victim voice is unprecedented and raises ethical concerns. Legal experts warn of potential misuse and the influence of deceptive deepfakes in court proceedings. Despite this, Arizona law permits digital victim statements, and the AI video was supported by nearly 50 letters validating its sentiments. An appeal of the sentencing is underway, with defense questioning the judge’s reliance on the AI video.

The use of AI in this context has sparked a broader conversation about the role of technology in the justice system. While some legal experts caution against the potential for emotional manipulation and the challenges of verifying authenticity, others see it as a powerful tool for healing and representation. Arizona's judiciary is reportedly forming a committee to explore the ethical implications and establish guidelines for AI's use in courtrooms. As AI continues to permeate various facets of society, its integration into legal proceedings marks a significant evolution in how justice and technology intersect.

### National Gallery Acquires Enigmatic 16th-Century Altarpiece Featuring Drooling Dragon for $20 Million

The National Gallery in London has recently acquired a mysterious early 16th-century altarpiece titled The Virgin and Child With Saints Louis and Margaret for $20 million. Painted around 1510, the artwork features unusual elements, including a drooling dragon and an angel playing a mouth harp. Despite its high price tag, the painting's artist remains unidentified, and its origins are still debated among scholars. The altarpiece will be on public display starting May 10, 2025, as part of the gallery's bicentenary celebration. 

The painting's composition includes the Virgin Mary, baby Jesus, Saints Louis and Margaret, two angels, and a dragon. Notably, the dragon, representing Satan, is depicted with exaggerated features and drooling fangs, referencing the legend of St. Margaret being swallowed and later emerging unharmed. One angel plays a mouth harp, an instrument not typically associated with celestial music, while the other holds a book containing musical notation that has been identified as nonsensical. These elements contribute to the painting's unique and enigmatic character. 

The altarpiece's wooden panel has been dated to around 1483 using dendrochronology, with the wood identified as Baltic oak, commonly used in the Low Countries. The painting was first documented in 1602 at the Premonstratensian Abbey of Drongen in Ghent, Belgium. Stylistically, it shows influences from French painter Jean Hey and Netherlandish artists Jan van Eyck and Hugo van der Goes. Despite these clues, the painting's provenance and the identity of its creator remain subjects of ongoing research and debate.

### U.S. Rescinds AI Chip Export Restrictions, Easing Path for Tech Giants

In a significant policy shift, the Trump administration announced on May 7, 2025, its decision to rescind the Biden-era "AI Diffusion Rule," which was set to impose stringent export controls on advanced artificial intelligence (AI) chips. Originally scheduled to take effect on May 15, the rule aimed to limit the export of high-performance chips to over 100 countries, including key U.S. allies, to prevent potential misuse by adversarial nations. Critics, including major tech firms like Nvidia and AMD, argued that the rule was overly bureaucratic and could hinder American innovation and competitiveness in the global AI market. 

The revocation of the rule has been met with approval from industry stakeholders. Nvidia, which faced a projected $5.5 billion revenue loss due to the restrictions, saw its stock rise by 3% following the announcement. AMD also experienced a 1.8% increase in its share value. While the immediate relief is welcomed, analysts caution that the administration plans to introduce a new, simplified export control framework that balances national security concerns with the need to maintain U.S. leadership in AI technology. 

Despite the policy reversal, certain restrictions remain in place, particularly concerning exports to China. Nvidia has responded by developing a downgraded version of its H20 AI chip, tailored to comply with existing export controls while meeting the demands of Chinese tech companies like Tencent, Alibaba, and ByteDance. These firms have collectively placed orders totaling approximately $18 billion since January 2025. The Trump administration's forthcoming regulations are expected to further refine the U.S. approach to AI chip exports, aiming to safeguard national interests without stifling the growth of domestic tech industries.

### Wandering Supermassive Black Hole Shreds Star in Distant Galaxy

In a groundbreaking observation, astronomers have witnessed a star being torn apart by a rogue supermassive black hole drifting through space. This rare event, known as a tidal disruption event (TDE), was detected approximately 600 million light-years away and has provided new insights into the behavior of these cosmic giants. 

The black hole, not anchored at the center of a galaxy as is typical, revealed its presence through the intense flare of light emitted as it consumed the star. This phenomenon, designated AT2024tvd, was captured by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope and the Chandra X-ray Observatory. The observations showed the star being stretched into a thin stream of gas—a process dubbed "spaghettification"—before being swallowed by the black hole. 

Such wandering supermassive black holes are believed to result from galactic mergers, where gravitational interactions can eject black holes from their original locations. The detection of AT2024tvd not only confirms the existence of these nomadic black holes but also offers a unique opportunity to study their interactions with stars in the vastness of space. Astronomers are now keen to identify more such events to better understand the dynamics of black holes outside galactic centers.

### Former Supreme Court Justice David Souter Dies at 85

David Hackett Souter, who served on the U.S. Supreme Court for nearly two decades, died at age 85 on May 8, 2025, at his home in New Hampshire, the Court announced. He passed away peacefully, leaving behind a legacy as one of the most quietly influential justices in recent history. 

Appointed by President George H.W. Bush in 1990 as a conservative “stealth nominee,” Justice Souter surprised many by frequently siding with the Court’s liberal wing. He delivered the decisive vote in the 1992 decision Planned Parenthood v. Casey, reaffirming the core holding of Roe v. Wade, and later dissented in Bush v. Gore, opposing the conservative majority’s decision to halt Florida’s recount in the 2000 election. 

After retiring from the Supreme Court in 2009 and yielding his seat to Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Souter continued to sit by designation on the First Circuit Court of Appeals until 2020. He was celebrated for his intellectual rigor, reclusive New England lifestyle, and commitment to judicial independence—resisting efforts to televise Court proceedings and warning against civic ignorance as a threat to democracy. Chief Justice John Roberts praised Souter’s “uncommon wisdom and kindness” and said he “will be greatly missed.”
