### Romania's Political Earthquake: PM Resigns Amid Far-Right Surge

In a dramatic turn of events, Romanian Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu announced his resignation following the first round of the presidential election, where far-right nationalist George Simion secured a commanding lead. Simion, leader of the Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR), garnered approximately 41% of the vote, significantly ahead of centrist Bucharest Mayor Nicu»ôor Dan, who received about 21%. The ruling coalition's candidate, Crin Antonescu, failed to advance, prompting Ciolacu to step down and withdraw his Social Democratic Party (PSD) from the governing alliance, effectively dissolving the pro-European coalition.

Simion's rise has sent shockwaves through Romania's political landscape and raised concerns among European Union and NATO allies. Known for his nationalist rhetoric and skepticism towards the EU, Simion has expressed intentions to halt military aid to Ukraine and has shown admiration for former U.S. President Donald Trump. His potential presidency could realign Romania's foreign policy, distancing it from Western alliances and potentially isolating the country within the EU.

The upcoming runoff election on May 18 between Simion and Dan is poised to be a pivotal moment for Romania. Dan, representing pro-European and reformist ideals, faces the challenge of uniting a fragmented opposition to counter Simion's momentum. The outcome will not only determine Romania's domestic trajectory but also its role on the European stage, especially concerning support for Ukraine and adherence to EU principles.

### Skechers Steps Into Private Ownership With $9.4 Billion 3G Capital Deal

In a significant move within the footwear industry, Skechers USA Inc. has agreed to be acquired by investment firm 3G Capital for $9.4 billion. The deal, offering $63 per share, represents a 30% premium over Skechers' 15-day average stock price and was unanimously approved by the company's board. Upon completion, Skechers will transition from a publicly traded company to a privately held entity, with current leadership, including CEO Robert Greenberg, remaining in place.

This acquisition occurs amid escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China, which have imposed significant tariffs on each other's goods. Skechers, which relies heavily on manufacturing in China and Vietnam, has faced challenges due to these tariffs, leading to increased costs and supply chain disruptions. Despite these hurdles, Skechers reported record revenues of $9 billion in 2024, demonstrating resilience in a volatile market.

3G Capital, known for its investments in consumer brands, plans to support Skechers in navigating these economic challenges and pursuing long-term growth. The acquisition is expected to close in the third quarter of 2025, pending regulatory approvals. Following the announcement, Skechers' stock surged approximately 25%, reflecting investor optimism about the company's future under private ownership.
