### U.S. Withdrawal from Ukraine Peace Talks Sparks Diplomatic Turmoil

High-level peace negotiations aimed at resolving the ongoing conflict in Ukraine unraveled this week after U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff abruptly withdrew from a pivotal summit in London. Their absence underscored growing tensions between the Trump administration and Ukrainian leadership, particularly over a U.S.-backed proposal that would recognize Russia's control over Crimea. President Donald Trump intensified pressure on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, accusing him of hindering peace efforts by rejecting the deal. Zelenskyy, however, maintained that ceding any Ukrainian territory was unconstitutional and non-negotiable. The U.S. withdrawal not only stalled the London talks but also signaled a potential shift in American foreign policy, with Vice President JD Vance warning that the U.S. might abandon its mediation role if both sides fail to agree to the proposed terms. European allies, caught off guard by the sudden developments, expressed concern over the diminishing prospects for a unified approach to ending the war.

### ‘Doomsday Mom’ Lori Vallow Daybell Convicted in Arizona Murder Conspiracy Trial

Lori Vallow Daybell, dubbed the "Doomsday Mom," has been found guilty by an Arizona jury of conspiring to murder her estranged fourth husband, Charles Vallow, in 2019. Already serving multiple life sentences in Idaho for the murders of her two children and her new husband's previous wife, Daybell now faces another potential life sentence. Prosecutors argued that Daybell, influenced by apocalyptic religious beliefs and motivated by financial gain, collaborated with her brother, Alex Cox, who fatally shot Charles Vallow. Daybell represented herself during the trial, asserting that the shooting was in self-defense. However, the jury deliberated for just three hours over two days before delivering the guilty verdict. She is scheduled to face another trial in June for allegedly conspiring to kill her niece’s ex-husband, who survived the attempt.
