### U.S. Withdrawal from Ukraine Peace Talks Sparks Diplomatic Turmoil

High-level peace negotiations aimed at resolving the ongoing conflict in Ukraine unraveled this week after U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff abruptly withdrew from a pivotal summit in London. Their absence underscored growing tensions between the Trump administration and Ukrainian leadership, particularly over a U.S.-backed proposal that would recognize Russia's control over Crimea. President Donald Trump intensified pressure on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, accusing him of hindering peace efforts by rejecting the deal. Zelenskyy, however, maintained that ceding any Ukrainian territory was unconstitutional and non-negotiable. The U.S. withdrawal not only stalled the London talks but also signaled a potential shift in American foreign policy, with Vice President JD Vance warning that the U.S. might abandon its mediation role if both sides fail to agree to the proposed terms. European allies, caught off guard by the sudden developments, expressed concern over the diminishing prospects for a unified approach to ending the war.

### White House Eyes Major Tariff Cuts on Chinese Imports Amid Trade War Fatigue

In a significant shift, the Trump administration is contemplating reducing tariffs on Chinese imports—currently as high as 145%—by more than half, signaling a potential de-escalation in the ongoing trade war. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent acknowledged that the existing tariff levels are unsustainable and emphasized the need for a "big deal" to rebalance trade relations between the U.S. and China. President Trump echoed this sentiment, describing the current tariffs as "very high" and expressing expectations for substantial reductions. The prospect of tariff relief has invigorated financial markets, with major indexes like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq posting significant gains. While China has indicated a preference for dialogue over conflict, it remains prepared to defend its interests if necessary. As both nations navigate the complexities of trade negotiations, the global economy watches closely for signs of a resolution to the protracted economic standoff.

### EU Slaps Apple and Meta with Landmark Fines Under Digital Markets Act

In a significant move to enforce its Digital Markets Act (DMA), the European Union has fined Apple €500 million and Meta €200 million for anti-competitive practices. Apple's penalty stems from its App Store policies that restricted developers from directing users to alternative payment options, thereby limiting competition and consumer choice citeturn0news8. Meta's fine addresses its "pay or consent" model on Facebook and Instagram, which compelled users to either pay for an ad-free experience or consent to data tracking for personalized ads citeturn0search4. Both companies have 60 days to comply with the EU's directives or face additional daily fines citeturn0search1. These actions mark the first enforcement under the DMA, signaling the EU's commitment to curbing monopolistic behaviors of major tech firms. While Apple and Meta plan to appeal, EU officials emphasize that the fines are a step toward ensuring fair competition and protecting consumer rights in the digital marketplace.

### ‘Doomsday Mom’ Lori Vallow Daybell Convicted in Arizona Murder Conspiracy Trial

Lori Vallow Daybell, dubbed the "Doomsday Mom," has been found guilty by an Arizona jury of conspiring to murder her estranged fourth husband, Charles Vallow, in 2019. Already serving multiple life sentences in Idaho for the murders of her two children and her new husband's previous wife, Daybell now faces another potential life sentence. Prosecutors argued that Daybell, influenced by apocalyptic religious beliefs and motivated by financial gain, collaborated with her brother, Alex Cox, who fatally shot Charles Vallow. Daybell represented herself during the trial, asserting that the shooting was in self-defense. However, the jury deliberated for just three hours over two days before delivering the guilty verdict. She is scheduled to face another trial in June for allegedly conspiring to kill her niece’s ex-husband, who survived the attempt.

### Israeli Government Deletes Condolence Post for Pope Francis Amid Diplomatic Strain

Following the death of Pope Francis, the Israeli government's official X account posted a condolence message stating, "Rest in Peace, Pope Francis. May his memory be a blessing," accompanied by an image of the pontiff at Jerusalem's Western Wall. However, the post was swiftly deleted, and Israeli diplomatic missions worldwide were instructed to remove similar messages and refrain from signing condolence books at Vatican embassies. This action reflects the deteriorating relations between Israel and the Vatican, exacerbated by Pope Francis's criticisms of Israel's military actions in Gaza, which he described as "cruelty" and suggested might constitute "genocide." While Israeli President Isaac Herzog offered condolences, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Foreign Minister Gidon Sa’ar remained silent. Israel's representation at the pope's funeral will be limited to its ambassador to the Vatican, marking a significant departure from past diplomatic engagements and underscoring the current tensions between the two states.

### Yale-Affiliated Nonprofit Wins $50 Million XPRIZE for Innovative Carbon Removal Strategy

On Earth Day 2025, Mati Carbon, a nonprofit organization rooted in Yale University research, secured the $50 million grand prize in the XPRIZE Carbon Removal competition. The organization employs enhanced rock weathering, a process that involves spreading crushed basalt on agricultural fields to accelerate natural chemical reactions that sequester atmospheric CO₂ into stable bicarbonates, effectively storing carbon for millennia. This method not only mitigates climate change but also enriches soil health, benefiting smallholder farmers in countries like India, Zambia, and Tanzania. Yale geochemist Noah Planavsky, a key figure in this initiative, co-invented the isotope dilution technology used by Mati Carbon and chairs its scientific advisory board. The XPRIZE judges lauded Mati Carbon's approach for its scalability, cost-effectiveness, and potential to remove 100 million tonnes of CO₂ by 2040, marking a significant advancement in global carbon removal efforts.

### Cold Memories Ignite Metabolic Fires: The Brain’s Role in Thermoregulation

In a groundbreaking study published in *Nature*, researchers have unveiled that the brain's memory of cold environments can trigger metabolic responses to generate heat, even in the absence of actual cold stimuli. By conditioning mice to associate specific environments with cold temperatures, scientists observed that re-exposure to these environments led to increased metabolic activity, regardless of the current temperature. This response is mediated by "cold memory engrams"—specific neuronal ensembles in the hippocampus—that, when reactivated, communicate with the hypothalamus to initiate thermogenic processes. These findings highlight a novel mechanism by which the brain integrates past experiences to anticipate and prepare for environmental challenges, offering potential insights into metabolic regulation and therapeutic avenues for metabolic disorders.
