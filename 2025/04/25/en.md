### Terror in the Valley: The 2025 Pahalgam Massacre and Its Aftermath

On April 22, 2025, the serene Baisaran Valley near Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir was shattered by a brutal terrorist attack that claimed the lives of at least 26 tourists and injured over 20 others. The assailants, identified as members of The Resistance Front (TRF)—an offshoot of the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba—targeted Hindu male tourists, reportedly verifying identities through religious tests before executing victims at close range. This heinous act, the deadliest on civilians in the region since the 2008 Mumbai attacks, was purportedly motivated by opposition to perceived demographic changes in Kashmir. The massacre has reignited tensions between India and Pakistan, with both nations taking retaliatory diplomatic and economic measures, including visa suspensions and trade halts. As the international community condemns the violence and urges restraint, the attack underscores the fragile peace in a region long marred by conflict and highlights the persistent threat of militancy in South Asia.

### From Allergy to Empowerment: How Daily Peanut Exposure is Transforming Lives

For years, adults with severe peanut allergies have lived in constant fear of accidental exposure. Now, a groundbreaking clinical trial from King's College London offers new hope. The Grown Up Peanut Immunotherapy (GUPI) study involved 21 adults aged 18 to 40, who were gradually introduced to increasing doses of peanut flour under medical supervision. Remarkably, 67% of participants could tolerate the equivalent of five peanuts after several months, significantly reducing their sensitivity. One participant, Chris Brookes-Smith, who once nearly died from a peanut reaction, now eats four peanuts daily to maintain his desensitization. While not a cure, this approach has been life-changing, offering participants freedom from the anxiety of accidental exposure and improving their quality of life.
