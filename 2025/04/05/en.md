### Unveiling the Hidden Patterns Behind a $3.5 Billion Crypto Collapse

In a groundbreaking study, researchers from Queen Mary University of London have uncovered the hidden patterns that led to the dramatic collapse of the TerraUSD stablecoin and its associated currency, LUNA. Using advanced mathematical techniques, the team identified suspicious trading patterns that suggest a coordinated attack by a small group of traders. These traders dominated the market, leading to a catastrophic loss of $3.5 billion in value almost overnight. The study, led by Dr. Richard Clegg, employed temporal multilayer graph analysis to map the relationships between different cryptocurrencies on the Ethereum blockchain. This analysis revealed that just a handful of traders controlled nearly all trading activity, indicating a deliberate attempt to destabilize the system. The research not only sheds light on this specific collapse but also introduces a powerful new tool for analyzing cryptocurrency markets, offering valuable insights for regulators and investors to mitigate future risks.

### Judge Stops White House from Cutting NIH Funding

A federal judge has stopped the Trump administration from cutting funds to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The administration wanted to reduce money for research by limiting funds for "indirect costs," which help cover expenses like building maintenance and utilities. Many universities and hospitals argued that these cuts would harm important medical research on diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's. The judge's decision means that the funding will continue while the legal case goes on. This ruling is seen as a win for researchers who believe that cutting these funds would slow down medical progress and harm patients.

### Catholic Church Condemns Sale of Carlo Acutis Relics Online

The Catholic Church is taking a firm stand against the online sale of relics belonging to Carlo Acutis, a young Italian boy who is set to become the first millennial saint. Carlo, who passed away from leukemia at the age of 15, was known for his deep faith and technological savvy, having created an online exhibit about eucharistic miracles. As his canonization approaches, the Church has called on Italian police to investigate the unauthorized sale of his relics, which include small parts of his body or clothing. These relics are considered sacred and are meant to be preserved in churches for veneration, not sold for profit. The Church emphasizes that such sales are not only disrespectful but also sinful, as they commercialize faith. The Diocese of Assisi has already taken action to remove these items from online auctions, where they were being sold for thousands of euros. The Church continues to work with authorities to prevent further sales and protect the sanctity of Carlo Acutis' relics.

## The Hot Schrödinger's Cat: A New Chapter in Quantum Physics

In a groundbreaking experiment, scientists have successfully created "hot Schrödinger cat states," challenging the long-held belief that quantum phenomena require extremely cold conditions. Traditionally, quantum experiments involved cooling particles to near absolute zero to observe superposition, where particles exist in multiple states simultaneously. However, researchers from the University of Innsbruck have demonstrated that these quantum states can be achieved at temperatures up to 1.8 Kelvin, which is significantly warmer than previous experiments. By using transmon qubits in a microwave resonator, they managed to maintain quantum properties even in these warmer conditions. This discovery opens new possibilities for practical quantum technologies, as it suggests that expensive and complex cooling systems might not be necessary for future quantum devices. The success of this experiment not only broadens our understanding of quantum mechanics but also paves the way for more accessible and cost-effective quantum technologies.
