### Trump's 100-Day Approval Rating Hits Historic Low in 80 Years

As President Donald Trump marks the 100th day of his second term, his approval rating has plummeted to a historic low, with only 39% of Americans expressing approval—a figure not seen in over eight decades. This downturn is attributed to controversial policies, including aggressive tariffs that have unsettled markets, and a series of executive actions perceived as overreaching presidential authority. Notably, support among women and Hispanic Americans has significantly declined. Despite this, Trump maintains strong backing from his Republican base, with approximately 90% approval, and continues to lead Democrats in public trust on key issues like immigration. The administration remains steadfast in its agenda, planning further executive actions to reshape U.S. policy and governance.

### The New American Dream: Starter Homes at $1 Million

In a striking shift from traditional housing norms, a recent Zillow analysis reveals that in 233 U.S. cities, the typical starter home now commands a price tag of $1 million or more. This surge, up from just 85 cities five years ago, underscores a growing affordability crisis affecting half of all U.S. states. While California leads with 113 such cities, states like New York, New Jersey, Florida, and even Minnesota and Rhode Island are witnessing similar trends. Factors such as pandemic-era price growth, limited housing supply, and restrictive building regulations have contributed to this escalation, making homeownership increasingly elusive for first-time buyers. As the median age of first-time buyers rises and their share of home purchases declines, the dream of owning a modest home becomes a million-dollar endeavor for many Americans.

### AI's Growing Attention Span: A New Era of Human-AI Collaboration on the Horizon

Artificial intelligence is advancing at a breathtaking pace, with new research showing that the complexity of tasks AI can handle doubles roughly every seven months. While AIs already outshine humans on quick, simple assignments, the real breakthrough lies in their improving ability to manage long, intricate projects — the true hallmark of intelligence. This exponential growth suggests that by 2032, AI could be capable of completing a month's worth of human software development, fundamentally changing how we work and live. As AI systems evolve from single-task performers into generalist agents capable of managing diverse and prolonged responsibilities, businesses, and consumers alike will see a shift: from AI as a helpful tool to AI as a trusted partner in everyday life and professional arenas.

### Jurassic Chic: T-Rex Leather Handbags Set to Roar into Luxury Fashion

In a groundbreaking fusion of science and fashion, researchers are developing the world's first handbags crafted from lab-grown Tyrannosaurus rex leather. This innovative endeavor, led by Lab-Grown Leather Ltd., The Organoid Company, and creative agency VML, utilizes advanced tissue engineering and synthetic biology to reconstruct T. rex collagen from fossilized amino acid fragments. By employing AI to complete ancient protein sequences, scientists synthesize DNA encoding the collagen, which is then inserted into animal cells to produce laboratory-grown T. rex leather. The result is a sustainable, cruelty-free material that mirrors the durability and texture of traditional leather. Initial applications will focus on luxury accessories, with a flagship fashion item expected by the end of 2025. Beyond fashion, the technology holds potential for broader applications, including automotive interiors, offering a glimpse into a future where prehistoric biology inspires sustainable innovation.

### Immunotherapy Breakthrough Offers Hope for Cancer Patients

In a groundbreaking development, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center has reported that immunotherapy alone has successfully treated various cancers with mismatch repair-deficient (MMRd) mutations, eliminating the need for surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation in many cases. The clinical trial involved 103 patients with different cancer types, including rectal, gastric, colon, esophageal, and urothelial cancers. Remarkably, 100% of rectal cancer patients and nearly 80% of all participants responded positively to treatment with dostarlimab, an immunotherapy drug, achieving remission without traditional invasive therapies. This approach not only spares patients from the debilitating side effects associated with conventional treatments but also significantly improves their quality of life.
