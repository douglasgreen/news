### Canada Votes in 'Trump Election' Amid Tariff Threats and Sovereignty Concerns

In a dramatic turn of events, Canadians headed to the polls today in a federal election overshadowed by U.S. President Donald Trump's aggressive rhetoric and economic threats. What began as a contest focused on domestic issues transformed into a referendum on national sovereignty, following Trump's imposition of sweeping tariffs on Canadian goods and provocative suggestions that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state . These actions ignited a surge of nationalism across Canada, bolstering support for Liberal leader and former central banker Mark Carney, who positioned himself as a bulwark against U.S. interference. Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, initially favored to win, saw his momentum wane as voters reacted to his perceived alignment with Trump's populist style . A record 7.3 million Canadians cast early ballots, many motivated by concerns over economic stability and national identity . As polls close, the nation awaits results that will not only determine its leadership but also its stance in an increasingly strained relationship with its southern neighbor.

### Justice in Paris: Kim Kardashian Faces Her 2016 Robbers in Court

Nearly a decade after Kim Kardashian was bound, gagged, and robbed at gunpoint during Paris Fashion Week, the long-awaited trial of ten suspects has begun in the French capital. The accused, dubbed the "Grandpa Robbers" due to their advanced ages and criminal histories, face charges including armed robbery and kidnapping. The heist, which occurred in October 2016, involved masked men posing as police officers who infiltrated Kardashian's hotel room, stealing nearly $9 million in jewelry, including a $4 million ring gifted by Kanye West. French authorities initially arrested 17 individuals in connection with the crime, with ten now standing trial. Among them is Yunice Abbas, 71, who has admitted his involvement and plans to apologize in court. Kardashian, now 44, is expected to testify in person, seeking closure from the traumatic event that left her fearing for her life. The trial is scheduled to run through May 23, marking a significant step toward justice in one of France's most high-profile criminal cases in recent memory.
