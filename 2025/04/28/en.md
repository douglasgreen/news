### Canada Votes in 'Trump Election' Amid Tariff Threats and Sovereignty Concerns

In a dramatic turn of events, Canadians headed to the polls today in a federal election overshadowed by U.S. President Donald Trump's aggressive rhetoric and economic threats. What began as a contest focused on domestic issues transformed into a referendum on national sovereignty, following Trump's imposition of sweeping tariffs on Canadian goods and provocative suggestions that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state. These actions ignited a surge of nationalism across Canada, bolstering support for Liberal leader and former central banker Mark Carney, who positioned himself as a bulwark against U.S. interference. Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, initially favored to win, saw his momentum wane as voters reacted to his perceived alignment with Trump's populist style. A record 7.3 million Canadians cast early ballots, many motivated by concerns over economic stability and national identity. As polls close, the nation awaits results that will not only determine its leadership but also its stance in an increasingly strained relationship with its southern neighbor.

### Trump's Tariff Revenue Falls Short of $3 Billion Daily Promise

President Donald Trump's assertion that U.S. tariffs are generating $3 billion daily has been met with skepticism and contradiction from economic analysts and official data. According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the actual daily revenue from tariffs averages around $250 million, a figure significantly lower than the president's claim. This discrepancy is attributed to a decrease in imports, as businesses adjust to the new trade policies and associated costs. Economists warn that such tariffs, while intended to bolster domestic industries, often lead to higher consumer prices and can strain international trade relations. The administration's optimistic projections have raised concerns about the potential economic impact and the accuracy of the revenue estimates being presented to the public.

### Justice in Paris: Kim Kardashian Faces Her 2016 Robbers in Court

Nearly a decade after Kim Kardashian was bound, gagged, and robbed at gunpoint during Paris Fashion Week, the long-awaited trial of ten suspects has begun in the French capital. The accused, dubbed the "Grandpa Robbers" due to their advanced ages and criminal histories, face charges including armed robbery and kidnapping. The heist, which occurred in October 2016, involved masked men posing as police officers who infiltrated Kardashian's hotel room, stealing nearly $9 million in jewelry, including a $4 million ring gifted by Kanye West. French authorities initially arrested 17 individuals in connection with the crime, with ten now standing trial. Among them is Yunice Abbas, 71, who has admitted his involvement and plans to apologize in court. Kardashian, now 44, is expected to testify in person, seeking closure from the traumatic event that left her fearing for her life. The trial is scheduled to run through May 23, marking a significant step toward justice in one of France's most high-profile criminal cases in recent memory.

### Shedeur Sanders’ Draft Slide Sparks White House Briefing and NFL Controversy

The surprising draft-day slide of quarterback Shedeur Sanders turned into a national talking point, even making its way into a White House press briefing on Monday. After President Donald Trump publicly criticized NFL owners for overlooking Sanders in the first round, reporters questioned whether Trump's comments influenced the Cleveland Browns’ eventual decision to draft Sanders with the 144th pick. While the White House played it off lightheartedly, the reality paints a complex picture: despite Trump’s endorsement and intense media scrutiny led by ESPN's Mel Kiper Jr., Sanders’ fall was driven by NFL teams weighing off-field distractions against raw talent. Now, the Browns must balance analytics, media frenzy, and locker room dynamics as Sanders' presence promises to keep the spotlight burning in Cleveland.

### Text Neck: The Hidden Toll of Our Screen-Obsessed Lives

A recent systematic review published in BMC Public Health has unveiled a concerning link between prolonged sedentary behavior and neck pain. Analyzing data from 25 studies encompassing over 43,000 participants across 13 countries, researchers found that individuals engaging in more than six hours of sedentary activity daily—particularly screen-based tasks like smartphone use—faced an 88% higher risk of developing neck pain compared to their more active counterparts. Mobile phone usage emerged as the most significant contributor, increasing the likelihood of neck pain by 82%, followed by computer use at 23%. The study attributes this trend to lifestyle shifts, including increased remote work and digital engagement post-pandemic, leading to poor posture and muscle strain in the neck and upper back. These findings underscore the pressing need for public awareness and interventions to mitigate the musculoskeletal impacts of our increasingly screen-centric routines.
