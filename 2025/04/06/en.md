### Israeli Military Revises Account of Gaza Medics' Deaths After Video Evidence Emerges

In a recent development, the Israeli military has altered its initial explanation regarding the deaths of 15 Palestinian medics in Gaza. Initially, the military claimed that the medics were killed because their vehicles approached Israeli troops suspiciously, without proper identification. However, video footage has surfaced showing the medics in clearly marked emergency vehicles, contradicting the military's account. The footage, reportedly from a paramedic's phone, depicts the medics in their uniforms and ambulances with lights on, being fired upon. This revelation has led to calls for an independent investigation to ensure accountability and justice for the victims. The incident has sparked outrage from international humanitarian organizations, emphasizing the need for the protection of medical personnel in conflict zones. The Israeli military is currently reviewing the video evidence to understand the discrepancies in their initial report.

### Global Trade Talks Ignite as 50 Nations Respond to U.S. Tariffs

The recent announcement of new tariffs by the Trump administration has sparked a wave of international negotiations, with 50 countries eager to engage in trade discussions. Agricultural Secretary Brooke Rollins highlighted the swift response from global partners, emphasizing the administration's focus on revitalizing the American economy by prioritizing domestic goods and industries. Rollins noted that countries like Taiwan have already proposed zero tariffs as a basis for trade talks, while others are keen to address existing trade imbalances. The tariffs, which aim to protect American farmers and industries, have led to a flurry of diplomatic activity, as nations seek to mitigate the impact on their economies. Despite concerns about potential retaliatory measures and market volatility, Rollins remains optimistic about achieving positive outcomes that will bolster the U.S. economy and strengthen its position as a global economic leader.

### Canada Steps Up as China Limits Rare Earth Exports to the U.S.

In response to U.S. tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, China has decided to restrict exports of rare earth minerals to the United States. These minerals are crucial for various industries, including technology and defense. As China controls a significant portion of the global supply, this move could lead to shortages in the U.S. However, Canada is emerging as a potential alternative supplier. With companies like Rio Tinto in Quebec producing scandium, Canada is poised to fill some of the gaps left by China's export restrictions. This shift could help stabilize the supply chain for rare earths, which are essential for manufacturing electronics and aerospace components. As Canada ramps up its production capabilities, it may play a crucial role in supporting U.S. industries that rely heavily on these critical minerals.

### Legal Battle Over Trump Tariffs Sparks Market Turmoil

A new lawsuit has been filed against the U.S. government, challenging the legality of tariffs imposed by former President Donald Trump. The lawsuit, initiated by a Florida stationery company, argues that the tariffs, particularly those on Chinese imports, were implemented without proper legal authority. This legal challenge comes amid a backdrop of significant market instability, as the tariffs have led to a sharp decline in stock markets worldwide. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones have experienced their worst performances since the COVID-19 pandemic, with fears that the tariffs will lead to higher consumer prices and slower economic growth. As global trade tensions rise, countries like China have vowed to retaliate, further escalating the situation. The outcome of this legal battle could have far-reaching implications for international trade and economic policies.
