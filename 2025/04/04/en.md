### South Korea Celebrates Yoon's Impeachment Amidst Political Uncertainty

In South Korea, the streets of Seoul were filled with both jubilation and apprehension as citizens celebrated the impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol. The constitutional court's unanimous decision to uphold the impeachment marked the end of a tumultuous period characterized by Yoon's controversial declaration of martial law, which had plunged the nation into political chaos. While many rejoiced at the court's ruling, seeing it as a victory for democracy and the rule of law, the path ahead remains challenging. The upcoming presidential election, set to occur within 60 days, presents a daunting task for the new leader who will need to mend deep societal divisions and restore trust in democratic institutions.

### Russia's New Ally: The Taliban

In a surprising turn of events, Russia is moving to legalize the Taliban, a group it once labeled as a terrorist organization. President Vladimir Putin now refers to the Taliban as a "trusted ally," marking a significant shift in Moscow's approach since the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan in 2021. This change is part of Russia's broader strategy to increase diplomatic engagement with the Taliban, which has been ruling Kabul since the U.S. withdrawal. The Russian Supreme Court is set to hear a case on April 17 to consider lifting the ban on the Taliban's activities in Russia. This move follows a law signed by Putin in December that allows for the suspension of bans on terrorist organizations. As Russia seeks to strengthen ties with the Taliban, it aims to enhance its influence in the region and counter the threat of the Islamic State, while also exploring potential economic benefits from closer relations with Afghanistan.

### The Dollar's Unexpected Dive: A Tale of Tariffs and Investor Fears

In a surprising turn of events, the U.S. dollar has weakened following President Trump's announcement of new tariffs, contrary to what economic theory typically predicts. Normally, higher tariffs would strengthen a country's currency by reducing the need for foreign exchange to buy imports. However, this time, the dollar's value dropped as investors grew concerned about the potential for a recession in the U.S. and the long-term risks associated with American policies. An index tracking the dollar against major currencies fell from 104 to 102.1, reflecting these worries. Investors had initially expected the dollar to rise with the tariff news, as tariffs have historically increased currency value. But the magnitude of these tariffs has spooked the markets, leading to a weaker dollar as fears of economic slowdown and increased inflation loom large.

### Trump's Simple Tariff Math Shakes Global Trade

In a surprising move, the Trump administration announced a new set of tariffs using a straightforward calculation method that has left many economists puzzled. Instead of targeting specific policies of trading partners, the administration applied a simple formula based on the U.S. trade deficit with each country. This formula divides the trade deficit by the country's exports to the U.S., then halves the result, with a minimum tariff of 10%. This approach has led to significant tariffs on countries like Vietnam and Norway, regardless of their actual trade practices. The simplicity of this method implies fewer opportunities for negotiation and relief, potentially escalating trade tensions. Critics argue that this method overlooks the complexities of international trade and could harm the U.S. economy by reducing both imports and exports. Despite the controversy, the administration maintains that these tariffs are necessary to address persistent trade deficits and protect American industries.

### Stock Market Tumbles as Tariff Tensions Rise

The stock market took a significant hit as the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by over 2,200 points, marking a 5.5% drop. This decline was part of a broader market downturn, with the Nasdaq Composite entering bear market territory after a 5.8% drop. The turmoil was triggered by President Donald Trump's announcement of new tariffs on U.S. trading partners, which led to a swift response from China, imposing 34% tariffs on U.S. imports. This escalation in the trade war has raised fears of a global economic slowdown, with investors worried about the impact on corporate profits and economic growth. Despite a positive jobs report, the uncertainty surrounding the tariffs has overshadowed market sentiment, leading to the largest weekly declines in major indexes since the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Powell Warns of Economic Challenges Amid New Tariffs

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell recently addressed the economic uncertainty caused by new tariffs announced by President Trump. Powell highlighted that these tariffs are larger than expected and could lead to higher inflation and slower economic growth. He emphasized the Fed's commitment to managing inflation expectations to prevent temporary price increases from becoming long-term issues. Despite President Trump's call for lower interest rates, Powell stated that the Fed would maintain its current policy until there is more clarity on the economic impact of the tariffs. The central bank is focused on balancing its dual mandate of maximizing employment and stabilizing prices, while economists warn of potential rising consumer prices and a global recession if the tariffs persist. Powell reassured that the Fed would continue to monitor the situation closely and make necessary adjustments to its policy.

### TikTok's Future in the U.S. Hangs in the Balance as Deadline Extended Again

The deadline for TikTok to find a non-Chinese buyer has been extended once more by President Trump, giving the app's owner, ByteDance, an additional 75 days to negotiate a deal. This decision comes amid ongoing talks with potential buyers like Oracle and Amazon, and concerns over national security due to TikTok's Chinese ownership. The extension aims to provide more time for securing necessary approvals and resolving key issues, including trade and tariff discussions between the U.S. and China. While ByteDance has not confirmed a sale, the app's future in the U.S. remains uncertain, with the new deadline set for mid-June. The situation highlights the complex interplay of international trade, politics, and technology, as both countries navigate the implications of a potential TikTok ban.

### Supreme Court Decision Halts Education Grants

The Supreme Court recently ruled in a 5-4 decision to allow the Trump administration to stop approximately $65 million in Education Department grants. These grants were part of programs aimed at improving teacher quality and supporting effective educator development. The administration argued that these programs violated its policy against diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. The majority opinion stated that the lower court did not have the authority to mandate the continuation of these grants under the Administrative Procedure Act. However, dissenting justices expressed concern that the administration had not sufficiently justified the cancellation of the grants and highlighted the potential harm to recipients. The decision marks a significant legal victory for the Trump administration, emphasizing ongoing tensions between executive authority and judicial oversight.

### Judge Orders Return of Maryland Man Mistakenly Deported to El Salvador

Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a legal resident of Maryland, was mistakenly deported to El Salvador due to an administrative error by the Trump administration. His wife, a U.S. citizen, filed a lawsuit to bring him back. A federal judge in Maryland ruled that the deportation was illegal and ordered the government to return Garcia by April 7, 2025. The government initially claimed it couldn't bring him back, citing jurisdictional issues, but the judge dismissed these arguments, emphasizing the lack of legal basis for Garcia's deportation. The case highlights concerns about the deportation process and the treatment of non-citizens, as well as the importance of due process and legal protections for immigrants. Garcia's wife expressed gratitude for the court's decision and vowed to continue fighting for her husband's return.

### Russell Brand Faces Serious Legal Battle Over Sexual Assault Charges

These incidents reportedly took place in Bournemouth and Westminster, London. Brand, who has denied all allegations, is set to appear in court on May 2nd. The investigation began after reports surfaced in Channel 4 and The Sunday Times, leading to a thorough review by the Crown Prosecution Service, which authorized the charges. Despite the gravity of the situation, Brand remains free and was informed of the charges through a postal requisition. The case has prompted internal reviews at media organizations that previously worked with Brand, resulting in apologies and further revelations of misconduct.
