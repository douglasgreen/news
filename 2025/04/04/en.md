### Russia's New Ally: The Taliban

In a surprising turn of events, Russia is moving to legalize the Taliban, a group it once labeled as a terrorist organization. President Vladimir Putin now refers to the Taliban as a "trusted ally," marking a significant shift in Moscow's approach since the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan in 2021. This change is part of Russia's broader strategy to increase diplomatic engagement with the Taliban, which has been ruling Kabul since the U.S. withdrawal. The Russian Supreme Court is set to hear a case on April 17 to consider lifting the ban on the Taliban's activities in Russia. This move follows a law signed by Putin in December that allows for the suspension of bans on terrorist organizations. As Russia seeks to strengthen ties with the Taliban, it aims to enhance its influence in the region and counter the threat of the Islamic State, while also exploring potential economic benefits from closer relations with Afghanistan.

## The Dollar's Unexpected Dive: A Tale of Tariffs and Investor Fears

In a surprising turn of events, the U.S. dollar has weakened following President Trump's announcement of new tariffs, contrary to what economic theory typically predicts. Normally, higher tariffs would strengthen a country's currency by reducing the need for foreign exchange to buy imports. However, this time, the dollar's value dropped as investors grew concerned about the potential for a recession in the U.S. and the long-term risks associated with American policies. An index tracking the dollar against major currencies fell from 104 to 102.1, reflecting these worries. Investors had initially expected the dollar to rise with the tariff news, as tariffs have historically increased currency value. But the magnitude of these tariffs has spooked the markets, leading to a weaker dollar as fears of economic slowdown and increased inflation loom large.

### Trump's Simple Tariff Math Shakes Global Trade

In a surprising move, the Trump administration announced a new set of tariffs using a straightforward calculation method that has left many economists puzzled. Instead of targeting specific policies of trading partners, the administration applied a simple formula based on the U.S. trade deficit with each country. This formula divides the trade deficit by the country's exports to the U.S., then halves the result, with a minimum tariff of 10%. This approach has led to significant tariffs on countries like Vietnam and Norway, regardless of their actual trade practices. The simplicity of this method implies fewer opportunities for negotiation and relief, potentially escalating trade tensions. Critics argue that this method overlooks the complexities of international trade and could harm the U.S. economy by reducing both imports and exports. Despite the controversy, the administration maintains that these tariffs are necessary to address persistent trade deficits and protect American industries.

### Trump's Tariffs Trigger Stock Market Turmoil

The stock market experienced a dramatic downturn as President Trump's new tariff policy sent shockwaves through global financial markets. On Thursday, the S&P 500 fell by 4.8%, marking its worst single-day drop since June 2020. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and the Russell 2000 also suffered significant losses, with declines of 6% and 6.6%, respectively. These tariffs, which impose a minimum 10% tax on nearly all imports, have sparked fears of rising prices and slower economic growth, potentially leading to a recession. Investors are particularly concerned about the impact on companies reliant on imports, such as tech and apparel firms, which saw substantial stock declines. While some hope the tariffs are a negotiation tactic, the immediate market reaction reflects widespread uncertainty and anxiety about the future of global trade.

### CERN's Ambitious Plan: A New Era of Particle Physics with the Future Circular Collider

CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, has unveiled plans for a groundbreaking project: the construction of a 91-kilometer particle collider tunnel beneath France and Switzerland. This ambitious endeavor, known as the Future Circular Collider (FCC), aims to operate at eight times the energy of the current Large Hadron Collider. The project is designed to delve deeper into the mysteries of the universe, including dark matter, dark energy, and antimatter. With an estimated cost of $27 billion, the FCC will feature eight research sites and tunnels passing under Lake Geneva. Construction could begin in the 2030s, with the first phase focusing on an electron-positron collider expected to start operations in the mid-2040s. This initiative represents a significant leap forward in particle physics, promising to enhance our understanding of the universe's fundamental components.
