### California Takes a Stand: Newsom's Legal Battle Against Trump's Tariffs

In a bold move, California Governor Gavin Newsom has announced a lawsuit challenging President Donald Trump's tariffs, marking the first time a state has taken legal action against these levies. The lawsuit, filed in federal court, argues that Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose tariffs is an overreach of presidential authority, as the power to levy tariffs rests with Congress. California, the world's fifth-largest economy, is particularly vulnerable to these tariffs due to its significant trade relationships with Mexico, Canada, and China. Newsom, alongside Attorney General Rob Bonta, emphasized the severe economic impact on California's industries, including agriculture, which could lose billions in revenue. The lawsuit seeks to halt the enforcement of these tariffs, which Newsom claims are causing "immediate and irreparable harm" to the state's economy. As the legal battle unfolds, it highlights the tension between state and federal powers and the broader implications of trade policies on local economies.

### K2-18b: A Glimpse into Potential Extraterrestrial Life

In a groundbreaking discovery, astronomers have detected potential biosignatures in the atmosphere of exoplanet K2-18b, located 124 light-years away from Earth. Using the James Webb Space Telescope, the team identified dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide, chemicals typically produced by marine organisms on Earth, suggesting the possibility of life. K2-18b, a Hycean planet with a hydrogen-rich atmosphere and potential liquid oceans, orbits within the habitable zone of its star, making it a prime candidate for hosting life. While the findings are promising, the researchers remain cautious, emphasizing the need for further investigation to confirm these biosignatures. This discovery marks a significant step in the quest to determine whether life exists beyond our Solar System, potentially bringing us closer to answering the age-old question of whether we are alone in the universe.

### A Landmark Treaty: Global Unity in Pandemic Preparedness Without the US

In a historic move, the World Health Organization (WHO) member states have agreed on the first global pandemic treaty, marking a significant step towards international cooperation in health crisis management. This treaty, finalized after three years of intense negotiations, aims to prevent the chaotic and unequal responses seen during the COVID-19 pandemic. Notably absent from this agreement is the United States, which withdrew from the negotiations following a change in administration. Despite this, the treaty is celebrated as a victory for multilateralism, demonstrating that global solidarity can prevail even in a divided world. The agreement includes commitments to equitable vaccine distribution, enhanced protections for health workers, and improved global data sharing on emerging pathogens. While the treaty awaits formal adoption, it represents a foundational shift towards a more unified global health strategy, underscoring the importance of collaboration in addressing shared threats.

### Kennedy's Controversial Stance on Autism Sparks Debate

In his first news conference as the U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary, Kennedy stirred controversy by labeling autism as an "epidemic" and attributing its rise to "environmental toxins." His remarks have drawn criticism from researchers who argue that such claims lack scientific backing and could mislead the public. Kennedy's assertion that autism is "preventable" has intensified the debate, with experts emphasizing the need for evidence-based approaches to understanding autism spectrum disorders. As the discussion unfolds, the focus remains on balancing public health messaging with scientific integrity.
