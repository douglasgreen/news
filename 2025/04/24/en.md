### Trump Pressures Ukraine to Cede Territory Amid Controversial Peace Push

President Donald Trump is intensifying efforts to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, urging Kyiv to accept a U.S.-proposed plan that would recognize Russian control over Crimea and other occupied territories. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has firmly rejected the proposal, citing constitutional constraints and concerns over national sovereignty. Trump, expressing frustration, has criticized Zelenskyy for prolonging the conflict by refusing to concede territory, while simultaneously calling on Russian President Vladimir Putin to halt attacks on Ukrainian cities, including a recent deadly strike on Kyiv. The U.S. administration has indicated that failure to reach an agreement soon could lead to a withdrawal from peace efforts, raising tensions among European allies who fear the implications of legitimizing territorial gains achieved through military aggression.

### EU Targets Google and X in Expanding Big Tech Crackdown

The European Union is intensifying its regulatory actions against major U.S. tech companies, with Alphabet's Google and Elon Musk's X (formerly Twitter) poised as the next targets. This follows the recent imposition of â‚¬700 million ($797 million) in fines on Apple and Meta for violations of the Digital Markets Act (DMA), a law designed to curb anti-competitive practices by dominant digital platforms. EU antitrust chief Teresa Ribera emphasized that all companies operating within the EU must adhere to its laws and values, dismissing concerns over potential U.S. retaliatory tariffs. While the fines are relatively modest, the EU's focus is on ensuring compliance and fostering competition rather than imposing heavy penalties. Google faces potential orders to divest parts of its adtech business due to concerns over monopolistic control, a move supported by a recent U.S. court ruling. Meanwhile, X is under investigation for breaches of the Digital Services Act, with a decision expected soon. These actions underscore the EU's commitment to enforcing digital regulations and promoting a fair competitive environment in the tech industry.

### Trump Appeals to Supreme Court to Reinstate Transgender Military Ban Amid Legal Challenges

On April 24, 2025, President Donald Trump's administration petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to lift a nationwide injunction preventing the enforcement of an executive order banning transgender individuals from serving in the military. The administration argues that the ban is essential for maintaining military readiness and discipline. This move follows a federal appeals court's decision to uphold a lower court's block on the policy, citing potential violations of the Fifth Amendment's equal protection clause. The Supreme Court has requested responses from the plaintiffs by May 1, 2025. This development is part of a broader series of actions by the Trump administration aimed at rolling back transgender rights, including efforts to eliminate federal support for transgender healthcare and restrict participation in gender-specific sports.

### Namibia's President Unveils Free University Education Starting 2026

In a landmark move, Namibia's newly inaugurated President Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah announced that, beginning in 2026, the government will fully subsidize tuition and registration fees for students attending public universities and vocational training centers. This initiative, revealed during her first State of the Nation Address, aims to expand access to higher education and address the country's high youth unemployment rate, which currently stands at 44.4%. President Nandi-Ndaitwah emphasized that the policy responds to long-standing public demands for comprehensive educational support and is intended to enhance opportunities for the nation's youth amid widespread unemployment and poverty. While Namibia currently offers free public primary and secondary education, associated costs like uniforms and supplies remain. The new policy will benefit two state-run universities and seven vocational centers, marking a significant step toward educational reform in the southern African nation of approximately 3 million people, where around 2.1 million citizens are under the age of 35.
