### Trump Pressures Ukraine to Cede Territory Amid Controversial Peace Push

President Donald Trump is intensifying efforts to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, urging Kyiv to accept a U.S.-proposed plan that would recognize Russian control over Crimea and other occupied territories. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has firmly rejected the proposal, citing constitutional constraints and concerns over national sovereignty. Trump, expressing frustration, has criticized Zelenskyy for prolonging the conflict by refusing to concede territory, while simultaneously calling on Russian President Vladimir Putin to halt attacks on Ukrainian cities, including a recent deadly strike on Kyiv. The U.S. administration has indicated that failure to reach an agreement soon could lead to a withdrawal from peace efforts, raising tensions among European allies who fear the implications of legitimizing territorial gains achieved through military aggression.

### EU Targets Google and X in Expanding Big Tech Crackdown

The European Union is intensifying its regulatory actions against major U.S. tech companies, with Alphabet's Google and Elon Musk's X (formerly Twitter) poised as the next targets. This follows the recent imposition of €700 million ($797 million) in fines on Apple and Meta for violations of the Digital Markets Act (DMA), a law designed to curb anti-competitive practices by dominant digital platforms. EU antitrust chief Teresa Ribera emphasized that all companies operating within the EU must adhere to its laws and values, dismissing concerns over potential U.S. retaliatory tariffs. While the fines are relatively modest, the EU's focus is on ensuring compliance and fostering competition rather than imposing heavy penalties. Google faces potential orders to divest parts of its adtech business due to concerns over monopolistic control, a move supported by a recent U.S. court ruling. Meanwhile, X is under investigation for breaches of the Digital Services Act, with a decision expected soon. These actions underscore the EU's commitment to enforcing digital regulations and promoting a fair competitive environment in the tech industry.

### Trump Appeals to Supreme Court to Reinstate Transgender Military Ban Amid Legal Challenges

On April 24, 2025, President Donald Trump's administration petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to lift a nationwide injunction preventing the enforcement of an executive order banning transgender individuals from serving in the military. The administration argues that the ban is essential for maintaining military readiness and discipline. This move follows a federal appeals court's decision to uphold a lower court's block on the policy, citing potential violations of the Fifth Amendment's equal protection clause. The Supreme Court has requested responses from the plaintiffs by May 1, 2025. This development is part of a broader series of actions by the Trump administration aimed at rolling back transgender rights, including efforts to eliminate federal support for transgender healthcare and restrict participation in gender-specific sports.

### Highland Park Parade Shooter Sentenced to Life Without Parole

In a significant legal conclusion to the 2022 Highland Park tragedy, Robert Crimo III has been sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Crimo, 24, pleaded guilty in March to seven counts of first-degree murder and 48 counts of attempted murder for the mass shooting during a Fourth of July parade that left seven dead and dozens injured. Lake County Judge Victoria Rossetti imposed seven consecutive life sentences, plus 50 years for each attempted murder count, emphasizing that Crimo is "irretrievably depraved" and beyond rehabilitation. During the emotional two-day sentencing hearing, survivors and victims' families shared harrowing testimonies, though Crimo chose not to attend or address the court. The sentencing marks the end of a prolonged legal process and brings a measure of justice to a community still grappling with the aftermath of the attack.

### Namibia's President Unveils Free University Education Starting 2026

In a landmark move, Namibia's newly inaugurated President Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah announced that, beginning in 2026, the government will fully subsidize tuition and registration fees for students attending public universities and vocational training centers. This initiative, revealed during her first State of the Nation Address, aims to expand access to higher education and address the country's high youth unemployment rate, which currently stands at 44.4%. President Nandi-Ndaitwah emphasized that the policy responds to long-standing public demands for comprehensive educational support and is intended to enhance opportunities for the nation's youth amid widespread unemployment and poverty. While Namibia currently offers free public primary and secondary education, associated costs like uniforms and supplies remain. The new policy will benefit two state-run universities and seven vocational centers, marking a significant step toward educational reform in the southern African nation of approximately 3 million people, where around 2.1 million citizens are under the age of 35.

### Shannon Sharpe Steps Away from ESPN Amid $50 Million Sexual Assault Lawsuit

Shannon Sharpe, Pro Football Hall of Famer and ESPN analyst, has announced his decision to temporarily step away from his role on "First Take" following a $50 million civil lawsuit filed against him by a former girlfriend alleging sexual assault and abuse.

### "You Can’t Lick a Badger Twice": Google’s AI Turns Gibberish into Gospel

In a bizarre yet revealing twist, Google's AI Overviews feature is confidently defining nonsensical phrases as if they were time-honored idioms. Users discovered that entering fabricated sayings like “You can’t lick a badger twice” into Google Search, followed by the word “meaning,” prompts the AI to generate plausible-sounding explanations. For instance, it interprets the aforementioned phrase as a warning against deceiving someone a second time after they've been tricked once . This phenomenon highlights a fundamental flaw in generative AI: its reliance on predicting likely word sequences without genuine understanding. As a result, the AI fabricates definitions and even historical contexts for these invented idioms, presenting them with unwarranted authority. While amusing, this issue underscores the potential for misinformation, especially when users might take these AI-generated explanations at face value . Google acknowledges these limitations, emphasizing that AI Overviews are experimental and advising users to approach such content with skepticism.

Global Coral Reefs Face Unprecedented Bleaching Amid Record Ocean Heat

The world's coral reefs are undergoing the most extensive bleaching event ever recorded, with approximately 84% of reef areas affected due to unprecedented ocean heat driven by climate change and the El Niño climate pattern. This crisis, which began in early 2023, has impacted reefs across at least 83 countries and territories, including the Great Barrier Reef, the Florida Keys, and the Caribbean. Elevated sea temperatures cause corals to expel the symbiotic algae essential for their survival, leading to widespread coral death. Scientists warn that without significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, coral reefs could largely disappear by 2100. Efforts are underway to conserve and restore coral, but experts stress that mitigating climate change is crucial to prevent further degradation of these vital ecosystems.

### Chicken Consumption Linked to Increased Mortality Risk, Study Finds

A recent study published in the journal Nutrients has found that consuming more than 300 grams (approximately 10.6 ounces) of poultry per week is associated with a 27% higher risk of death from all causes, including gastrointestinal cancers, compared to consuming less than 100 grams weekly. The study tracked 4,869 individuals in southern Italy over a 19-year period, analyzing their dietary habits and health outcomes. Notably, the increased risk was more pronounced in men, who faced over double the risk of gastrointestinal cancer mortality. While the study establishes a correlation rather than causation, experts suggest that factors such as cooking methods and meat processing could influence these outcomes. Health professionals recommend moderating poultry intake, opting for organic or pasture-raised options, and incorporating a variety of protein sources, including plant-based proteins and seafood, to promote better health outcomes.
