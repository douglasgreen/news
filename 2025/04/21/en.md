### Market Turmoil as Trump Targets Fed Chair Powell

In a dramatic turn of events, the U.S. stock markets experienced a significant downturn as President Donald Trump intensified his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted over 1,000 points, reflecting investor anxiety over Trump's demands for immediate interest rate cuts. Trump's aggressive rhetoric, labeling Powell a "major loser" for not lowering rates, has reignited fears of economic instability.

As the markets react to these developments, the Federal Reserve faces mounting pressure to navigate the economic challenges posed by both domestic and international factors. Investors are closely watching the situation, concerned about the potential implications of Trump's ongoing attacks on the Fed's independence and the broader impact on global financial stability.

### Microsoft's Recall Feature: A Second Chance or a Privacy Concern?

In a bold move, Microsoft has reintroduced its controversial Recall feature in Windows 11, sparking a mix of intrigue and concern among users.
