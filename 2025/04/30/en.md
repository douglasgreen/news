### Trade Turbulence: U.S. Economy Contracts 0.3% in First Quarter of 2025 Amid Tariff Uncertainty

In the first quarter of 2025, the U.S. economy experienced a 0.3% annualized contraction, marking its first decline in three years. This downturn was primarily driven by a surge in imports, as businesses accelerated purchases to preempt President Donald Trump's newly announced tariffs, leading to a record-high trade deficit in March. Consumer spending growth slowed to 1.8%, down from 4% in the previous quarter, and federal government spending decreased by 5.1%. Despite a 21.9% increase in business investment and a 3% rise in core GDP metrics, financial markets reacted negatively, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping 400 points. Inflation also accelerated, with the Federal Reserve's preferred gauge rising to 3.6%, intensifying concerns about stagflationâ€”a combination of stagnant growth and rising prices. President Trump attributed the economic slowdown to policies of his predecessor, while economists remain divided on the outlook, with some projecting a rebound in the second quarter but warning that ongoing tariff uncertainties may hinder sustained growth.
