### Israel Launches Airstrike in Syria Amid Sectarian Clashes to Protect Druze Minority

In response to escalating sectarian violence near Damascus, Israel conducted a targeted airstrike on April 30, 2025, against an extremist group allegedly preparing attacks on Druze communities in Sahnaya. The region has been engulfed in unrest following the circulation of a falsified audio recording attributed to a Druze cleric, which incited retaliatory violence and led to at least 16 deaths over two days. Israel's intervention underscores its commitment to safeguarding the Druze minority, a community with significant populations in Syria, Lebanon, and Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu emphasized the operation as a warning to Syria's Islamist-led government, urging it to protect minority groups and prevent further sectarian strife. Meanwhile, efforts for de-escalation are underway, with Druze leaders and Syrian officials engaging in talks to restore stability in the affected areas.

### Trade Turbulence: U.S. Economy Contracts 0.3% in First Quarter of 2025 Amid Tariff Uncertainty

In the first quarter of 2025, the U.S. economy experienced a 0.3% annualized contraction, marking its first decline in three years. This downturn was primarily driven by a surge in imports, as businesses accelerated purchases to preempt President Donald Trump's newly announced tariffs, leading to a record-high trade deficit in March. Consumer spending growth slowed to 1.8%, down from 4% in the previous quarter, and federal government spending decreased by 5.1%. Despite a 21.9% increase in business investment and a 3% rise in core GDP metrics, financial markets reacted negatively, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping 400 points. Inflation also accelerated, with the Federal Reserve's preferred gauge rising to 3.6%, intensifying concerns about stagflation—a combination of stagnant growth and rising prices. President Trump attributed the economic slowdown to policies of his predecessor, while economists remain divided on the outlook, with some projecting a rebound in the second quarter but warning that ongoing tariff uncertainties may hinder sustained growth.

### Mock Kidnapping Hazing at Westhill High Lacrosse Team Sparks Criminal Charges

In Syracuse, New York, a severe hazing incident involving the Westhill High School boys' lacrosse team has led to criminal charges against 11 students. The accused lured younger teammates under the pretense of a team outing, only to stage a mock abduction in a remote area. During the incident, one victim was tied up, blindfolded, and placed in a car trunk, while others were confronted by individuals dressed in black and wielding what appeared to be a gun and a knife. Onondaga County District Attorney William Fitzpatrick condemned the act as "hazing on steroids," emphasizing its potential for serious harm. All suspects have since turned themselves in and face misdemeanor charges of unlawful imprisonment. In response, the school district has canceled the remainder of the lacrosse season and is conducting an internal investigation to address the team's culture and ensure student safety.

### Limestone University to Close After 180 Years Following Unsuccessful $6M Fundraising Effort

Limestone University, a 180-year-old private Christian institution in Gaffney, South Carolina, will permanently close at the end of the semester after failing to raise the $6 million needed to stay open. Despite a two-week fundraising campaign that garnered approximately $2.1 million from over 200 donors, the university could not secure sufficient funds. Enrollment had declined from about 3,200 students in 2014 to approximately 1,600, with factors such as changing demographics and the COVID-19 pandemic contributing to the downturn. The closure affects both campus and online programs, leaving several hundred faculty and staff without jobs. Students will receive assistance in transferring to other institutions, and donations will be refunded. The final commencement is scheduled for Saturday.

### ESA's Biomass Satellite Launches to Map Earth's Forests and Carbon Storage

On April 29, 2025, the European Space Agency (ESA) successfully launched the Biomass satellite aboard a Vega-C rocket from French Guiana. Equipped with a 12-meter deployable P-band radar antenna, Biomass is designed to penetrate forest canopies and measure the woody biomass beneath, providing critical data on carbon storage in Earth's forests. This mission aims to enhance our understanding of how climate change and deforestation affect forest density and carbon capture globally. Over its five-year mission, Biomass will orbit Earth 15 to 16 times daily at an altitude of approximately 666 kilometers, focusing initially on tropical forests where data is currently lacking. The satellite's advanced radar technology, developed by Airbus, represents the first global-scale use of such instrumentation for biomass estimation, offering more accurate and comprehensive insights than previous methods. Scientists anticipate preliminary data within days, with public datasets to be available in about a year, supporting policy-making and international agreements on forest conservation.

### Florida Legislature Passes Bill Restricting Water Additives, Including Fluoride

In a significant legislative move, Florida's lawmakers have passed a bill that effectively bans the addition of fluoride and other health-related additives to public drinking water. The measure, part of the broader Florida Farm Bill (SB 700), does not explicitly mention fluoride but prohibits local governments from introducing any substances into water supplies beyond those necessary to meet basic drinking standards. Proponents of the bill, including Governor Ron DeSantis and Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo, argue that this ensures personal freedom and protects against potential health risks associated with high fluoride levels. However, the bill has drawn criticism from dental and public health professionals who emphasize fluoride's proven benefits in preventing tooth decay, particularly among children and underserved communities. If signed into law, Florida will become the second state after Utah to implement such a ban, marking a significant shift in public health policy and igniting a nationwide debate over the role of fluoride in community water systems.
