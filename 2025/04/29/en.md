### Study Reveals Alarming Rise in Abortion Pill Complications, Sparks Renewed FDA Scrutiny

A groundbreaking new study analyzing over 865,000 cases of mifepristone use has found that serious complications from the abortion pill are 22 times higher than the rate previously reported on its FDA label. Published by the Ethics and Public Policy Center, the study reveals that nearly 11% of women who used the drug experienced severe outcomes such as hemorrhaging, sepsis, or hospitalization—contradicting earlier claims that placed the rate below 0.5%. Researchers argue that real-world insurance data paints a far more dangerous picture than controlled clinical trials, prompting calls for the FDA to reinstate safety measures that were relaxed over the past two decades. With medication abortions now representing the majority of U.S. abortions, these findings are likely to fuel ongoing legal, political, and medical debates over the drug’s regulation and the broader abortion landscape.
