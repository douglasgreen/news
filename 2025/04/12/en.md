### Living Immigrants Listed as Dead: A Controversial Move by the Trump Administration

In a controversial move, the Trump administration has directed the Social Security Administration to classify over 6,000 living immigrants as deceased. This action effectively cancels their Social Security numbers, making it difficult for them to work, access financial services, or receive government benefits. The administration claims this measure is intended to encourage these immigrants to "self-deport" by removing financial incentives. However, critics argue that this is an unprecedented and harsh tactic that violates the rights of individuals who were legally residing in the U.S. under previous immigration programs. The move has sparked outrage among immigrant advocates and lawmakers, who describe it as an abuse of power and a form of "digital murder." They warn that this could set a dangerous precedent, potentially affecting more immigrants and even citizens in the future.

### Relief for Tech Giants as Trump Exempts Electronics from New Tariffs

In a surprising move, President Donald Trump announced that smartphones, computers, and other electronics will be exempt from the latest round of tariffs imposed on Chinese imports. This decision comes as a relief to major tech companies like Apple, which heavily rely on Chinese manufacturing for their products. The exemption, effective from April 5, 2025, spares these electronics from the steep 145% tariff rate that was recently introduced. Analysts have hailed this as positive news for the tech industry, which faced potential price hikes and supply chain disruptions. While the exemption alleviates immediate concerns, the Trump administration continues to push for tech companies to relocate their manufacturing to the United States, aiming to reduce dependency on China for critical technologies. This development marks a significant moment in the ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, offering a temporary reprieve for consumers and tech investors alike.

### Judge Orders USDA to Release Funds to Maine Amid Transgender Athlete Policy Dispute

A federal judge has ordered the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to unfreeze funds for Maine, marking a significant legal victory for the state. The funds were initially withheld due to Maine's policy allowing transgender athletes to compete in girls' sports, which the Trump administration argued violated Title IX, a federal law prohibiting sex-based discrimination in education. The judge ruled that the USDA did not follow the proper legal procedures before freezing the funds, which are crucial for feeding schoolchildren and vulnerable adults. Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey emphasized that the ruling confirms the administration's failure to adhere to the rule of law. While the decision does not address the broader debate over transgender athletes, it ensures that Maine will continue to receive necessary federal support without interruption.

### Judge Blocks Deportation of Over 500,000 Migrants, Citing Legal Misinterpretation

A federal judge, appointed by former President Obama, has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's plan to deport over 500,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. These migrants were initially granted temporary protected status (TPS) under a Biden-era program. The Trump administration had revoked this status, giving the migrants 30 days to leave the U.S. voluntarily. However, Judge Indira Talwani argued that the decision to end the TPS was based on a misreading of the law. She emphasized that the migrants, who entered the U.S. legally through a parole program, should not be treated as illegal immigrants. The judge's ruling provides temporary relief to the migrants, allowing them to stay in the U.S. while the case proceeds. This decision highlights ongoing legal battles over immigration policies and the interpretation of laws governing temporary protected status.

### Microsoft Unveils Debug-Gym to Boost AI Debugging Skills

Microsoft Research has introduced a new tool called Debug-Gym, designed to enhance AI's ability to debug software. Debugging is a critical part of software development, but AI models have traditionally struggled with this task. Debug-Gym provides AI with access to advanced debugging tools, allowing it to set breakpoints, navigate code, and examine variables. This interactive environment helps AI models improve their debugging performance by enabling them to explore and rewrite code based on context, rather than relying solely on training data. Although AI's debugging capabilities have improved with Debug-Gym, they still fall short of human expertise. The tool is available on GitHub and represents a significant step towards integrating AI more effectively into real-world software engineering tasks. Human oversight remains essential, as AI-proposed fixes require approval from experienced developers. This initiative highlights the ongoing efforts to bridge the gap between AI and human developers in the realm of debugging.

### Ansky: The Black Hole That Woke Up and Surprised the Universe

In a distant galaxy named SDSS1335+0728, about 300 million light-years away, a supermassive black hole known as Ansky has astonished astronomers with its unexpected behavior. After decades of dormancy, Ansky suddenly erupted with powerful X-ray bursts, releasing a hundred times more energy than any similar event observed before. This awakening began in 2019 when the galaxy started shining brightly, but it wasn't until 2024 that the black hole's regular, intense X-ray flares were detected. These quasiperiodic eruptions (QPEs) are ten times longer and more luminous than typical ones, challenging existing models of black hole behavior. Scientists are puzzled by Ansky's activity, as it doesn't fit the usual pattern of a black hole consuming a nearby star. Instead, the bursts might be linked to gravitational waves, offering a unique opportunity to study these cosmic giants in real time and potentially reshape our understanding of black holes and their role in the universe.
