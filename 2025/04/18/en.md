### Visa Revocations Leave International Students in Limbo

In a sweeping move that has left the academic community reeling, more than 1,000 international students and graduates in the United States have had their visas revoked or their statuses terminated. This sudden action, part of a broader immigration crackdown, has sparked widespread panic among students who now face the threat of deportation. Many of these students, hailing from countries like India and China, have been caught off guard, with some reportedly targeted over minor infractions such as traffic violations. Legal challenges are mounting, with lawsuits filed in several states arguing that these students were denied due process. The lack of clear communication from federal authorities has only exacerbated the situation, leaving students and universities scrambling to understand the criteria for these revocations. As the legal battles unfold, the affected students find themselves in a precarious position, uncertain of their future in the country they have come to call home.

### Escalation in Yemen: US Airstrikes on Houthi-Controlled Oil Port Result in Heavy Casualties

In a significant escalation of military actions, U.S. airstrikes targeted the Ras Isa oil port in Yemen, a facility controlled by the Houthi rebels, resulting in at least 58 deaths and 126 injuries. The strikes, part of President Trump's intensified campaign against the Iran-backed Houthis, aimed to cut off a crucial source of fuel and revenue for the group. The attack has been condemned by the Houthis as a violation of Yemen's sovereignty, labeling it a "full-fledged war crime." The U.S. Central Command stated that the operation was intended to degrade the Houthis' economic power, emphasizing that the strikes were not aimed at harming Yemeni civilians. The incident has further internationalized the conflict, with accusations of Chinese satellite companies aiding Houthi attacks, and has drawn widespread condemnation due to the civilian casualties and the strategic importance of the port, which is vital for Yemen's imports and humanitarian aid. The situation remains tense as the international community watches closely, with potential implications for ongoing U.S.-Iran negotiations.

### Trump Administration Halts New York Offshore Wind Project, Sparking Industry Concerns

In a surprising move, the Trump administration has ordered a halt to the construction of the Empire Wind 1 project off the coast of New York, citing concerns over the approval process conducted by the previous administration. The project, led by Norwegian company Equinor, was set to generate 810 MW of renewable energy, enough to power 500,000 homes, and create thousands of jobs. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum stated that the project was "rushed through" without adequate analysis, prompting the stop-work order. This decision has sent shockwaves through the renewable energy sector, with industry leaders and local officials expressing concerns over the potential impact on New York's climate goals and economic development. Governor Kathy Hochul has vowed to challenge the federal decision, emphasizing the importance of the project for green job creation and energy transition. As the offshore wind industry grapples with this setback, the halt raises broader questions about the stability of renewable energy projects under shifting political landscapes.

In the animated film "The King of Kings," directed by Seong-ho Jang, the timeless story of Jesus Christ is brought to life through the imaginative lens of Charles Dickens.

Initially skeptical, Walter is drawn into the tale of Jesus, experiencing the Nativity, Ministry, Passion, and Resurrection alongside his feline sidekick. As the story progresses, Walter's skepticism transforms into a profound understanding of Jesus' sacrifice and love. This journey of redemption is beautifully illustrated, culminating in Walter's realization of the true "King of Kings." The film, featuring a star-studded voice cast including Kenneth Branagh and Uma Thurman, offers a fresh perspective on the gospels, making it accessible and engaging for young audiences while subtly weaving in themes of family, faith, and love.

### Beyond the Spectrum: The Discovery of 'Olo,' a New Color Perception

In a groundbreaking experiment, researchers have pushed the boundaries of human vision by stimulating the retina to perceive a novel color, termed 'olo.' This color, described as a richer blue-green, was achieved by selectively activating medium-wavelength cones in the retina using laser pulses. Unlike any naturally occurring color, 'olo' can only be experienced through this precise retinal stimulation, a feat not possible with natural light. The experiment involved mapping the retina to locate these specific cones and using a laser to stimulate them individually, resulting in a unique visual experience. While some experts argue that 'olo' is merely a highly saturated green, the researchers emphasize its unprecedented saturation and potential implications for understanding visual perception. This discovery, published in Science Advances, not only challenges our understanding of color but also holds promise for advancing treatments for vision disorders, offering new insights into how the brain processes visual information.

### Federal Website Shift Sparks Debate Over COVID-19 Origins

In a controversial move, the U.S. government has replaced its primary COVID-19 information website, covid.gov, with a new platform that emphasizes the lab leak theory as the origin of the pandemic. This change has sparked significant debate, as the previous site provided essential resources on vaccines, testing, and treatments. The new site presents arguments supporting the lab leak hypothesis, suggesting the virus may have escaped from a Wuhan laboratory, while acknowledging that the origin remains undetermined. This shift has drawn criticism from scientists who argue it misrepresents scientific evidence and is politically motivated. However, some welcome further investigation into the pandemic's origins, emphasizing the importance of preventing future outbreaks. The website also critiques the government's pandemic response, including lockdowns and mask mandates, and references a House investigation that concluded a lab leak was the most likely scenario. Despite these claims, many scientists still support the zoonotic origin theory, pointing to evidence of a natural spillover event from animals to humans. The debate over the virus's origins continues, highlighting the complexities and challenges in reaching a consensus.
