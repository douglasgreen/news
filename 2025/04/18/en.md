### Visa Revocations Leave International Students in Limbo

In a sweeping move that has left the academic community reeling, more than 1,000 international students and graduates in the United States have had their visas revoked or their statuses terminated. This sudden action, part of a broader immigration crackdown, has sparked widespread panic among students who now face the threat of deportation. Many of these students, hailing from countries like India and China, have been caught off guard, with some reportedly targeted over minor infractions such as traffic violations. Legal challenges are mounting, with lawsuits filed in several states arguing that these students were denied due process. The lack of clear communication from federal authorities has only exacerbated the situation, leaving students and universities scrambling to understand the criteria for these revocations. As the legal battles unfold, the affected students find themselves in a precarious position, uncertain of their future in the country they have come to call home.

### Escalation in Yemen: US Airstrikes on Houthi-Controlled Oil Port Result in Heavy Casualties

In a significant escalation of military actions, U.S. airstrikes targeted the Ras Isa oil port in Yemen, a facility controlled by the Houthi rebels, resulting in at least 58 deaths and 126 injuries. The strikes, part of President Trump's intensified campaign against the Iran-backed Houthis, aimed to cut off a crucial source of fuel and revenue for the group. The attack has been condemned by the Houthis as a violation of Yemen's sovereignty, labeling it a "full-fledged war crime." The U.S. Central Command stated that the operation was intended to degrade the Houthis' economic power, emphasizing that the strikes were not aimed at harming Yemeni civilians. The incident has further internationalized the conflict, with accusations of Chinese satellite companies aiding Houthi attacks, and has drawn widespread condemnation due to the civilian casualties and the strategic importance of the port, which is vital for Yemen's imports and humanitarian aid. The situation remains tense as the international community watches closely, with potential implications for ongoing U.S.-Iran negotiations.
