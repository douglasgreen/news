### Global Trade Tensions Shake Confidence in US Treasuries

In recent weeks, global investors have been selling off US Treasuries, traditionally seen as a safe investment, due to growing fears of a global trade war. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note has climbed to about 4.5%, the highest in six weeks, as investors worry about the potential impact of the trade conflict on the US economy and inflation. This sell-off has been particularly noticeable in countries like Japan and Australia, reflecting broader concerns about market stability. As the trade war escalates, many fear it could lead to a recession, causing investors to rethink their strategies and seek other safe havens.

### The Rising Cost of Parenthood: A 35% Increase Since 2023

In recent years, the financial burden of raising a child has significantly increased, as highlighted by a new study from LendingTree. Since 2023, the annual cost of raising a child has surged by 35%, with expenses varying greatly depending on where families live. For instance, in states like Hawaii, Massachusetts, and Washington, parents can expect to spend between $32,000 and $36,000 each year. Conversely, families in Mississippi, South Carolina, and Alabama face lower costs, ranging from $16,000 to $18,000 annually. This dramatic rise in expenses is largely driven by increased costs in child care, food, and health insurance, making it more challenging for parents to manage their budgets effectively. As these costs continue to climb, families are urged to plan carefully and consider the financial implications of raising children in different geographic locations.

### Elon Musk and Peter Navarro Clash Over Tariff Policies

Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, recently criticized Peter Navarro, President Trump's top trade adviser, calling him a "moron" and "dumber than a sack of bricks." This heated exchange occurred after Navarro claimed that Tesla is more of a "car assembler" than a manufacturer, as it relies on foreign parts. Musk fired back on social media, asserting that Tesla has the most American-made cars and that Navarro's statements were false. The disagreement highlights a significant rift within Trump's administration over the new tariffs that have impacted global markets. While Navarro defends the tariffs as a means to boost American manufacturing, Musk advocates for a zero-tariff policy to foster stronger trade relations between the U.S. and Europe. Despite the public spat, the White House downplayed the conflict, attributing it to differing views on trade.

### IMF and Argentina Agree on $20 Billion Bailout to Stabilize Economy

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has reached a preliminary agreement with Argentina for a $20 billion bailout. This deal is a significant step for Argentina as it aims to stabilize its economy under President Javier Milei's leadership. The agreement comes after Argentina's efforts to cut inflation and improve its fiscal situation through strict austerity measures. These measures have included reducing government spending and eliminating subsidies, which have helped to reverse the country's previous economic instability. The bailout is expected to provide much-needed financial support to replenish Argentina's foreign exchange reserves and support its economic reforms. However, the deal still requires final approval from the IMF's executive board. If approved, this financial assistance will help Argentina manage its debts and encourage foreign investment by easing strict currency controls.

### Judge Restores AP's White House Access After Naming Dispute

A federal judge has ordered the White House to restore the Associated Press's access to presidential events, following a dispute over the naming of the Gulf of Mexico. The conflict began when President Trump issued an executive order to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the "Gulf of America." The Associated Press, however, chose to continue using the traditional name in its reports, leading to its exclusion from White House events. Judge Trevor McFadden ruled that the government cannot exclude journalists based on their viewpoints, as it violates the First Amendment. The decision ensures that the AP can once again cover events in the Oval Office and other key locations, reaffirming the importance of press freedom in the United States. The ruling is seen as a significant victory for the AP and a reminder of the constitutional protections afforded to the press.

### American Academic Faces Legal Battle in Thailand Over Monarchy Insult Charges

### China Introduces GPMI: A New Era in Media Connectivity

China has unveiled a groundbreaking media communication standard called the General Purpose Media Interface (GPMI), developed by the Shenzhen 8K UHD Video Industry Cooperation Alliance. This new standard aims to revolutionize how we connect devices by supporting 8K resolution and reducing the number of cables needed for data and power transmission. GPMI comes in two versions: Type-B, with a proprietary connector, and Type-C, compatible with USB-C. The Type-C version offers a maximum bandwidth of 96 Gbps and can deliver 240 watts of power, while the Type-B version boasts an impressive 192 Gbps bandwidth and 480 watts of power delivery. This makes GPMI a formidable competitor to existing standards like HDMI and DisplayPort, offering more than double the data capacity of USB4 and Thunderbolt 4. Although GPMI's adoption outside China remains uncertain due to existing alliances with HDMI, its potential to simplify device connectivity and support high-resolution displays makes it a significant development in the tech industry.

### Meta Introduces New Safety Measures for Teens on Instagram

### Uranus' Day: A Little Longer Than We Thought

Scientists have discovered that a day on Uranus is slightly longer than previously believed. Using data from the Hubble Space Telescope, researchers found that Uranus takes 17 hours, 14 minutes, and 52 seconds to complete one full rotation. This is 28 seconds longer than the estimate made by the Voyager 2 spacecraft nearly 40 years ago. The new findings were made possible by tracking the planet's auroras over a decade, which helped pinpoint Uranus' magnetic poles more accurately. This discovery not only provides a more reliable coordinate system for Uranus but also opens up new possibilities for studying other celestial bodies with magnetic fields and auroras.

### Dinosaurs Thrived Until the Asteroid Struck

For many years, scientists believed that dinosaurs were already in decline before the asteroid impact that led to their extinction. However, recent studies suggest that this might not be the case. Researchers now argue that the perceived decline in dinosaur populations before the asteroid hit may be due to gaps in the fossil record rather than an actual decrease in their numbers. In fact, many dinosaur species were thriving and adapting to their environments right up until the catastrophic event. The asteroid impact, which occurred 66 million years ago, was a sudden and devastating blow that caused massive environmental changes, leading to the extinction of the dinosaurs. This new understanding highlights the importance of the fossil record in shaping our knowledge of prehistoric life and reminds us that there is still much to learn about the history of our planet.

This pioneering procedure has been hailed as a "medical breakthrough" by Health Secretary Wes Streeting, who expressed hope that such transplants might be available on the NHS in the future. Grace's daughter, Amy Isabel, was born via a planned caesarean section, marking a significant milestone in reproductive medicine. This success story not only brings joy to Grace and her family but also offers hope to many women who face similar challenges. The procedure, funded by the charity Womb Transplant UK, could pave the way for more women to experience the joy of motherhood, potentially transforming the landscape of fertility treatments in the UK.

### Pets Bring Joy and Wellbeing Comparable to Marriage, Study Finds

A recent study has revealed that owning a cat or dog can boost a person's wellbeing as much as being married. Researchers from the University of Kent found that the psychological benefits of having a pet are similar to those gained from marriage, equating to an increase in life satisfaction worth about £70,000 a year. The study used the "life satisfaction approach" to translate the emotional value of pet companionship into a hypothetical income. This research highlights the significant role pets play in enhancing human happiness and suggests that their presence can lead to improved mental and physical health. The findings could influence policies to make pet ownership more accessible, such as easing restrictions in rented housing or promoting therapy animal programs.
