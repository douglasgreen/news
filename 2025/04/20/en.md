### From Conviction to Candidacy: The Rise of Pardoned Jan. 6 Rioters in Politics

In a surprising turn of events, individuals who were once convicted for their involvement in the January 6 Capitol riots are now being celebrated as heroes and potential political candidates. Following President Donald Trump's controversial decision to pardon approximately 1,500 rioters on his first day back in office, these individuals have found themselves in the political spotlight. Among them is Ryan Kelley, a former Michigan gubernatorial candidate, who, despite his misdemeanor conviction, is being urged by supporters to run for office again. This phenomenon reflects a broader trend where pardoned rioters are being embraced by certain segments of the Republican base, not as criminals, but as patriots who stood up for their beliefs. As these individuals take the stage at various Republican events across the country, they are using their newfound platforms to share their narratives, often portraying themselves as victims of government overreach. This shift in perception raises questions about the evolving political landscape and the implications of mainstreaming such figures in American politics.

### DHL Halts High-Value Shipments to the U.S. Amid New Customs Regulations

In response to recent changes in U.S. customs regulations, DHL Express has announced a temporary suspension of business-to-consumer shipments valued over $800 to the United States. This decision comes as U.S. Customs and Border Protection now requires formal entry processing for shipments exceeding this value, a shift from the previous threshold of $2,500. The change has significantly increased the workload for customs processing, leading to multiday shipping delays. DHL aims to expand its customs brokerage operations to manage the surge in volume and maintain service quality. While business-to-business shipments and those under $800 remain unaffected, the suspension highlights the broader impact of evolving trade policies on global logistics and e-commerce.

### AI Personas: The New Frontier in Police Surveillance on Social Media

In a groundbreaking yet controversial move, police departments across the United States are deploying AI-powered bots to surveil and interact with suspects on social media. Developed by Massive Blue, the Overwatch system creates lifelike virtual agents that engage with individuals online, aiming to gather intelligence on a range of suspects, from human traffickers to political activists. These AI personas, equipped with detailed backstories and realistic digital profiles, are designed to build trust and extract information without revealing their true nature as law enforcement tools. While proponents argue that this technology could revolutionize crime-fighting by providing valuable leads, critics raise ethical concerns about privacy violations and the potential misuse of such technology against activists and protestors. Despite the promise of these AI agents, the effectiveness of Overwatch remains under scrutiny, as there have been no known arrests attributed to its use so far. As law enforcement agencies continue to explore the capabilities of AI in surveillance, the debate over its ethical implications and efficacy is likely to intensify.

Despite a strong start from Luka Dončić, who scored 37 points in his playoff debut with the Lakers, the Timberwolves' relentless offense and physical defense proved too much for the home team.

## Gmail Users on High Alert: Sophisticated Phishing Attack Exploits Google Infrastructure

In a recent wave of cyber threats, Google has issued an urgent warning to its 3 billion Gmail users about a sophisticated phishing attack that cleverly mimics legitimate Google communications. This attack exploits vulnerabilities within Google's own infrastructure, allowing attackers to send emails that appear authentic and pass through Google's security checks. The emails, often appearing to come from official Google addresses, lure users into clicking links that lead to phishing sites designed to steal login credentials. Despite Google's ongoing efforts to deploy fixes, the tech giant urges users to adopt stronger security measures, such as enabling two-factor authentication and using passkeys, to protect their accounts. This incident highlights the increasing sophistication of phishing attacks, often powered by AI, and underscores the importance of vigilance and proactive security practices among users.

On a serene Sunday morning, the Soyuz MS-26 spacecraft made a flawless parachute-assisted landing on the vast Kazakh steppe, marking the end of a remarkable 220-day mission aboard the International Space Station (ISS). The capsule carried a diverse crew: NASA astronaut Don Pettit, who celebrated his 70th birthday on the day of their return, and Roscosmos cosmonauts Alexey Ovchinin and Ivan Vagner.

### Brazil's Battle with Dengue: A Million Cases and Counting

In 2024, Brazil faced an unprecedented dengue epidemic, with over one million cases reported by mid-year. This alarming surge, five times the number of cases from the previous year, has been attributed to several factors, including the predominance of the DENV-2 serotype, which is known for causing severe cases and higher mortality rates. The epidemic has spread across the country, affecting both urban centers and smaller municipalities, highlighting the challenges posed by climate change, urbanization, and inadequate public health infrastructure. The Brazilian government has declared emergencies in multiple regions, emphasizing the need for targeted clinical management and improved surveillance to curb the spread of the disease.
