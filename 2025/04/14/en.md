### Trump's New Tariffs on Semiconductors Stir Global Trade Concerns

President Donald Trump has announced plans to impose new tariffs on semiconductors imported from China, sparking concerns of a potential trade war. The move comes after the administration temporarily exempted certain electronics from high tariffs, only to signal that these products will soon face new levies under a different tariff policy. The tariffs are part of a broader strategy to encourage domestic manufacturing and protect national security, as semiconductors are crucial for many defense systems. However, experts warn that these tariffs could lead to increased costs for U.S. tech companies and disrupt global supply chains, potentially affecting the prices of consumer electronics and hindering the growth of the semiconductor industry in the U.S. Critics argue that the tariffs could lead to economic chaos and are urging Congress to intervene to prevent further escalation.

### Trump Administration Shifts Focus Away from White-Collar Crime

In recent news, the Trump Administration has decided to step back from aggressively pursuing white-collar criminal cases. This change comes as the Department of Justice (DOJ) under Trump's leadership plans to prioritize other areas such as immigration, public safety, and national security. While white-collar enforcement will not be completely abandoned, it is expected to receive less attention compared to other pressing issues. This shift may lead to fewer resources being allocated to complex financial and corporate crime cases, potentially resulting in a temporary slowdown in enforcement actions. However, experts believe that once the initial transition period is over, there might be an increase in white-collar enforcement as line prosecutors gain more freedom to pursue cases without as much oversight from political appointees.

Garcia's wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, a U.S. citizen, has been tirelessly advocating for his return, emphasizing the emotional toll on their family. The case has sparked a legal battle, highlighting tensions between the judiciary and the executive branch over immigration policies. As the courts demand daily updates on Garcia's status, his family remains hopeful for his safe return, challenging the administration's claims and fighting for justice.

### Bats with Tiny Microphones Show How They Avoid Collisions in Crowded Skies

In the Hula Valley of Israel, thousands of greater mouse-tailed bats take flight from their cave at dusk, creating a scene that resembles a plume of smoke. Despite the chaos of so many bats flying together, collisions are rare. Scientists have equipped these bats with tiny microphones to understand how they navigate such crowded conditions. The bats use echolocation, emitting high-frequency sounds and listening for the echoes to detect obstacles and other bats. Even when their signals overlap, they manage to avoid crashes by focusing on the most important echoes, especially from bats directly in front of them. This study reveals how bats adapt their echolocation in real-time, ensuring safe passage through the night sky.
