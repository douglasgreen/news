### Myanmar's Military Declares Ceasefire Amid Earthquake Tragedy

In Myanmar, a powerful earthquake has caused widespread devastation, claiming over 3,000 lives and leaving many more injured. The disaster struck as the country was already grappling with a civil war, making the situation even more dire. In response, Myanmar's ruling military has declared a temporary ceasefire to allow for relief efforts. This pause in fighting is intended to help aid reach the affected areas more effectively. The ceasefire announcement came after similar moves by resistance groups, who also called for a halt in hostilities to focus on humanitarian needs. Despite the ceasefire, the military has warned that it will respond to any attacks or attempts to regroup by opposition forces. As rescue operations continue, international aid is pouring in to support the recovery and provide much-needed assistance to the survivors.

### Trump Fires National Security Staff After Meeting with Activist Laura Loomer

In a surprising move, President Donald Trump fired several National Security Council staff members following a meeting with far-right activist Laura Loomer. Loomer, known for her controversial views, presented Trump with a list of staff she claimed were disloyal to his agenda. This list included senior officials like Brian Walsh and Thomas Boodry. The meeting, attended by key figures such as Vice President JD Vance and Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, highlighted Loomer's influence within Trump's circle. Despite Trump's public dismissal of Loomer's sway, the firings suggest her recommendations were taken seriously. This incident underscores the ongoing tension within Trump's administration regarding loyalty and the influence of far-right voices.

### New Tariffs Shake Global Trade and Consumer Markets

In a recent announcement, President Trump introduced new tariffs on imported goods from several countries, including China and the European Union. These tariffs, ranging from 10% to 50%, are calculated based on each country's trade deficit with the U.S. and have sparked criticism from economists who find the methodology flawed. While some countries like Russia and Cuba are exempt due to existing sanctions, the tariffs are expected to significantly impact American consumers, potentially increasing household expenses by thousands of dollars annually. The stock market has already reacted negatively, and Congress is considering a bipartisan bill to require congressional approval for future tariffs. This move has raised concerns about potential recessions and a global trade war, as affected countries plan retaliatory tariffs. The new tariffs mark a shift from the Republican Party's traditional support for free trade, and businesses are now seeking ways to adapt their supply chains to mitigate the economic blow.

### Supreme Court Supports FDA's Ban on Flavored Vapes

In a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court upheld the FDA's decision to block the sale of flavored e-cigarettes that appeal to children. The court agreed with the FDA's stance that these products, with flavors like "Killer Kustard Blueberry" and "Pineapple Express," pose a significant risk to youth health by encouraging nicotine addiction. Justice Samuel Alito, writing for the court, dismissed claims from manufacturers that the FDA had acted unfairly by changing approval requirements mid-process. This ruling is seen as a victory for public health advocates who argue that flavored vapes contribute to a youth nicotine crisis. The decision sends a strong message about the importance of protecting children from potentially harmful products, while the case returns to a lower court for further review.

### Schools Face New Federal Funding Challenge Over DEI Policies

In a recent move by the Trump administration, K-12 schools across the United States are now required to sign a certification against Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) practices to continue receiving federal funding. This decision has sparked a significant debate, as schools must confirm their compliance with federal civil rights laws and eliminate any DEI initiatives deemed discriminatory. The administration argues that some DEI practices violate federal law by favoring one race over another, and schools that fail to comply risk losing crucial federal funds, including Title I funding aimed at supporting low-income areas. Critics argue that this requirement contradicts the administration's promise of returning educational control to local authorities and could lead to financial sanctions similar to those imposed on universities in the past. As schools scramble to understand and comply with these new requirements, the American Federation of Teachers has filed a lawsuit, claiming the mandate violates constitutional rights and improperly uses federal aid as leverage to enforce political ideology.

### AI or Human? The Surprising Results of a Modern Turing Test

In a recent study, researchers explored how well large language models (LLMs) can mimic human conversation by conducting a modified Turing test. Participants interacted with both an AI and a human, then guessed which was which. OpenAI's GPT-4.5, when given a specific persona, was mistaken for a human 73% of the time, showing its impressive ability to imitate human-like responses. However, without a persona, its success rate dropped significantly. The study also tested other models like Meta's LLaMa 3.1-405B and the older ELIZA chatbot, revealing varied performances. These findings highlight the growing sophistication of AI in mimicking human interaction, raising questions about the future of AI in social and economic roles. Researchers emphasize the need for ongoing evaluation of AI capabilities and their potential societal impacts.

### Tornadoes and Storms Cause Havoc in the South and Midwest

On Wednesday, violent storms swept through the South and Midwest, bringing with them powerful tornadoes that caused widespread destruction. In southeast Missouri, at least one person lost their life as the storms knocked down power lines and trees, tore roofs off homes, and sent debris flying high into the sky. The National Weather Service issued numerous tornado and severe thunderstorm warnings across several states, including Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, and Mississippi. The storms were fueled by a combination of daytime heating, an unstable atmosphere, and moisture from the Gulf. As the storms moved eastward, they were expected to bring potentially deadly flash flooding, with forecasts predicting historic rainfall totals over the coming days. More than 90 million people were at risk of severe weather, highlighting the widespread impact of this powerful storm system.

### Bonobos' Calls: A Glimpse into the Roots of Language

In the dense rainforests of the Democratic Republic of Congo, bonobos, our closest living relatives, are revealing secrets about the origins of language. Researchers have discovered that these great apes use a complex system of vocalizations, including peeps, hoots, and grunts, to communicate in ways that mirror human language. By combining different calls, bonobos can create new meanings, a trait known as nontrivial compositionality, which was once thought to be unique to humans. This groundbreaking study suggests that the ability to form complex meanings from simple sounds may have existed in our common ancestors millions of years ago. As scientists continue to decode the bonobo "dictionary," they are uncovering a fascinating link between these intelligent apes and the evolutionary roots of human language.

### Weekend Warriors: A Path to Healthier Living

A recent study has revealed that people who exercise primarily on weekends, known as "weekend warriors," can achieve similar health benefits as those who spread their workouts throughout the week. The research, which analyzed data from over 93,000 participants, found that weekend warriors experienced a 32% lower risk of death from all causes, a 31% lower risk from cardiovascular disease, and a 21% lower risk from cancer compared to inactive individuals. This suggests that the total amount of exercise per week is more crucial than how it is distributed. The study provides hope for those with busy schedules, indicating that even concentrated exercise over one or two days can significantly improve health outcomes. However, experts advise gradually increasing weekend exercise to minimize injury risks. The findings emphasize that maintaining a consistent exercise routine, regardless of its distribution, can lead to a healthier lifestyle and potentially longer life.
