### Myanmar's Military Declares Ceasefire Amid Earthquake Tragedy

In Myanmar, a powerful earthquake has caused widespread devastation, claiming over 3,000 lives and leaving many more injured. The disaster struck as the country was already grappling with a civil war, making the situation even more dire. In response, Myanmar's ruling military has declared a temporary ceasefire to allow for relief efforts. This pause in fighting is intended to help aid reach the affected areas more effectively. The ceasefire announcement came after similar moves by resistance groups, who also called for a halt in hostilities to focus on humanitarian needs. Despite the ceasefire, the military has warned that it will respond to any attacks or attempts to regroup by opposition forces. As rescue operations continue, international aid is pouring in to support the recovery and provide much-needed assistance to the survivors.

### Supreme Court Supports FDA's Ban on Flavored Vapes

In a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court upheld the FDA's decision to block the sale of flavored e-cigarettes that appeal to children. The court agreed with the FDA's stance that these products, with flavors like "Killer Kustard Blueberry" and "Pineapple Express," pose a significant risk to youth health by encouraging nicotine addiction. Justice Samuel Alito, writing for the court, dismissed claims from manufacturers that the FDA had acted unfairly by changing approval requirements mid-process. This ruling is seen as a victory for public health advocates who argue that flavored vapes contribute to a youth nicotine crisis. The decision sends a strong message about the importance of protecting children from potentially harmful products, while the case returns to a lower court for further review.

### AI or Human? The Surprising Results of a Modern Turing Test

In a recent study, researchers explored how well large language models (LLMs) can mimic human conversation by conducting a modified Turing test. Participants interacted with both an AI and a human, then guessed which was which. OpenAI's GPT-4.5, when given a specific persona, was mistaken for a human 73% of the time, showing its impressive ability to imitate human-like responses. However, without a persona, its success rate dropped significantly. The study also tested other models like Meta's LLaMa 3.1-405B and the older ELIZA chatbot, revealing varied performances. These findings highlight the growing sophistication of AI in mimicking human interaction, raising questions about the future of AI in social and economic roles. Researchers emphasize the need for ongoing evaluation of AI capabilities and their potential societal impacts.

### Tornadoes and Storms Cause Havoc in the South and Midwest

On Wednesday, violent storms swept through the South and Midwest, bringing with them powerful tornadoes that caused widespread destruction. In southeast Missouri, at least one person lost their life as the storms knocked down power lines and trees, tore roofs off homes, and sent debris flying high into the sky. The National Weather Service issued numerous tornado and severe thunderstorm warnings across several states, including Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, and Mississippi. The storms were fueled by a combination of daytime heating, an unstable atmosphere, and moisture from the Gulf. As the storms moved eastward, they were expected to bring potentially deadly flash flooding, with forecasts predicting historic rainfall totals over the coming days. More than 90 million people were at risk of severe weather, highlighting the widespread impact of this powerful storm system.
