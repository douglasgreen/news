### Trump Signs Executive Order to Boost U.S. Shipbuilding Industry

President Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at revitalizing the American shipbuilding industry. This order seeks to reduce China's influence in global shipping and strengthen the U.S. maritime sector. The plan includes creating tax breaks in "maritime opportunity zones" and increasing the U.S. Naval presence in the Arctic. It also aims to boost naval and cargo ship production in the United States. The order directs the Secretary of Defense to explore options to invest in and expand the Maritime Industrial Base, leveraging existing authorities to encourage public and private investment. Additionally, the order establishes a Maritime Security Trust Fund to provide consistent funding for maritime programs and a shipbuilding financial incentives program to encourage private investment. This initiative is seen as a significant step towards restoring America's maritime dominance and addressing national security concerns.

## China and the U.S. in a Trade War: Tariffs Rise and Tensions Grow

Many Chinese citizens support their government's strong stance, while in the U.S., there is concern about the impact on the economy and jobs. Both nations are feeling the pressure, and there is hope that dialogue will eventually lead to a resolution.

## Judge Rules Newsmax Defamed Dominion Voting Systems

A Delaware judge has ruled that Newsmax, a conservative news outlet, defamed Dominion Voting Systems by spreading false claims about the company's involvement in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. The judge found that Newsmax aired segments suggesting Dominion rigged the election to favor Joe Biden, despite lacking credible evidence. This ruling is a significant win for Dominion, which is seeking $1.6 billion in damages. The case will proceed to a jury trial to determine if Newsmax acted with "actual malice" and to decide on the damages. Newsmax, which recently went public, denies wrongdoing and plans to defend itself vigorously, arguing that the case threatens free speech and a free press. The trial is set to begin on April 28, unless a settlement is reached beforehand.

Ksenia Karelina, a ballerina from Los Angeles, was recently freed from a Russian prison where she had been held for treason.

She was accused of treason for donating $51.80 to a Ukrainian charity, which Russian authorities claimed was used to support the Ukrainian military. Her case drew international attention and was seen as part of a broader crackdown by Russia on dissent related to its conflict with Ukraine. After spending months in a penal colony, Karelina's release was secured in exchange for a Russian-German prisoner, marking a significant diplomatic negotiation between the two countries.
