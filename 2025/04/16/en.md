### US-Iran Indirect Talks Progress Amid Tensions and High Stakes

The first phase of indirect negotiations between the United States and Iran has concluded, setting the stage for a second round in Rome. These talks, mediated by Oman, aim to address the critical issues of sanctions relief and Iran's uranium enrichment levels, which are nearing weapons-grade.

Both nations are under pressure to reach a deal, with the U.S. seeking to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions and Iran aiming to alleviate the economic strain from sanctions.

### Nvidia Faces $5.5 Billion Charge Amid U.S. Export Restrictions on AI Chips to China

In a significant financial and strategic setback, Nvidia announced it will incur a $5.5 billion charge due to new U.S. government restrictions on exporting its H20 graphics processing units to China.

This development comes as part of the Trump administration's broader strategy to curb China's access to advanced AI technologies, fearing their potential use in supercomputing applications. The restrictions have not only impacted Nvidia's financial outlook but also sent shockwaves through the semiconductor industry, with shares of Nvidia and other chipmakers experiencing declines. As Nvidia grapples with this challenge, it underscores the growing geopolitical tensions in the tech sector and the delicate balance companies must maintain in navigating international trade policies.

### Russian Journalists Sentenced in Navalny 'Extremism' Case: A Blow to Press Freedom

In a controversial verdict that has drawn international condemnation, a Russian court sentenced four journalists to five and a half years in prison for alleged extremism linked to their work with the late opposition leader Alexei Navalny's anti-corruption foundation. The journalists, Antonina Favorskaya, Konstantin Gabov, Sergey Karelin, and Artyom Kriger, were accused of collaborating with Navalny's organization, which was banned and labeled as extremist by Russian authorities in 2021. Despite maintaining their innocence and asserting that they were merely fulfilling their duties as journalists, the closed-door trial resulted in convictions that many view as politically motivated. This case is part of a broader crackdown on dissent in Russia, which has intensified since the country's military actions in Ukraine. The sentencing has sparked outrage among human rights groups and advocates for press freedom, who argue that the charges are a thinly veiled attempt to silence independent journalism and stifle criticism of the Kremlin. The journalists' legal teams have vowed to appeal the verdict, highlighting the lack of evidence and the unjust nature of the trial.

### Astronomers Unveil the Universe's Hidden Half: A Cosmic Discovery

For decades, astronomers have been puzzled by the "missing matter" problem, where half of the universe's ordinary matter seemed to be unaccounted for. Recent breakthroughs have finally shed light on this cosmic mystery. By leveraging the cosmic microwave background as a backlight, researchers have discovered that this elusive matter exists as vast, diffuse clouds of ionized hydrogen gas, extending far beyond the visible edges of galaxies. This discovery was made possible by stacking images of millions of galaxies and analyzing the subtle alterations in the cosmic microwave background as it passed through these ionized gas clouds. The findings not only fill a significant gap in our understanding of the universe's composition but also suggest that supermassive black holes may be more active than previously thought, influencing the distribution of this gas. As this research undergoes peer review, it promises to refine our models of the universe and enhance our understanding of cosmic phenomena.
