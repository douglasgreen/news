## President Trump Announces Cabinet and Cabinet Level Appointments (Presidential Actions January 20, 2025)

President Trump has announced a list of individuals he is nominating for key positions in his Cabinet and other high-level roles. These nominations include Scott Bessent for Secretary of the Treasury, Pamela Bondi for Attorney General, and Marco Rubio for Secretary of State, among others. Each nominee is from a different state and will need to be confirmed by the Senate before officially taking on their roles.

The Cabinet is a group of the most senior appointed officers of the executive branch of the federal government, who are generally the heads of the federal executive departments. The Cabinet's role is to advise the President on any subject he may require relating to the duties of each member's respective office. These appointments are significant as they help shape the administration's policies and priorities.

In addition to the Cabinet positions, President Trump has also nominated individuals for other important roles, such as Tulsi Gabbard for Director of National Intelligence and John Ratcliffe for Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. These positions are crucial for national security and intelligence operations. The nominations reflect the President's choices for individuals he believes will effectively lead these departments and agencies.

## President Trump Announces Sub-Cabinet Appointments (Presidential Actions January 20, 2025)

President Trump has announced a series of sub-cabinet appointments, nominating individuals to various key positions within the U.S. government. These appointments include roles such as Assistant Secretary of Defense, Director of the National Institutes of Health, and Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget, among others. Each nominee is set to replace a predecessor who has either resigned or whose term has expired.

The nominations cover a wide range of departments and agencies, reflecting a significant reshuffle in the administration's leadership. For instance, Keith Bass from Texas is nominated as an Assistant Secretary of Defense, while Jayanta Bhattacharya from California is nominated to lead the National Institutes of Health. Other notable appointments include Frank Bisignano as Commissioner of Social Security and Todd Blanche as Deputy Attorney General.

These appointments are part of the president's executive powers, where he nominates individuals to serve in various governmental roles, subject to Senate confirmation. This process is crucial for ensuring that the executive branch of the government is staffed with individuals who align with the president's policy goals and administrative priorities.

## President Trump Announces Acting Cabinet and Cabinet-Level Positions (Presidential Actions January 20, 2025)

On January 20, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order to appoint individuals to serve in acting capacities for various cabinet and cabinet-level positions. This action is in accordance with the U.S. Constitution and federal laws, specifically referencing 5 U.S.C. 3345, which allows for temporary appointments to fill vacancies. The order lists individuals assigned to key roles such as Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, and Attorney General, among others, until permanent appointments are made.

This move is part of President Trump's initial actions upon taking office, aiming to ensure that essential government functions continue smoothly while permanent appointments are processed. The list includes a wide range of positions across different departments, reflecting the administration's immediate need to fill leadership roles to maintain government operations.

Overall, the executive order is a standard procedure for a new administration to temporarily fill critical positions, ensuring that the government remains functional and responsive during the transition period. This approach allows the administration to continue its work without interruption while permanent candidates are vetted and confirmed.

## President Trump Designates Chairmen and Acting Chairmen (Presidential Actions January 20, 2025)

President Trump's executive order on January 20, 2025, designates several individuals to lead various federal agencies and commissions. This order appoints Brendan Carr as Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Mark Christie as Chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and Henry Kerner as Acting Chairman of the Merit Systems Protection Board, among others. These appointments are significant as they place individuals in key positions that influence policy and regulatory decisions across different sectors, including communications, energy, labor relations, and civil rights.

The executive order is a directive from the President that manages operations within the federal government. It is a tool used by the President to ensure that the laws are faithfully executed, as mandated by the U.S. Constitution. While executive orders can direct federal agencies on how to implement laws, they cannot create new laws or override existing ones. The appointments made through this executive order reflect the administration's priorities and can significantly impact how federal policies are shaped and enforced.

Overall, this executive order is part of the broader use of executive powers by the President to manage the federal government's operations and ensure that the administration's policy goals are pursued effectively. These appointments are crucial as they determine the leadership and direction of important federal agencies, affecting various aspects of public policy and governance.

## Flying The Flag Of The United States At Full-Staff On Inauguration Day (Presidential Actions January 20, 2025)

On January 20, 2025, a U.S. presidential proclamation was issued to fly the American flag at full-staff on Inauguration Day. This decision honors the significance of Inauguration Day and the values it represents for the nation. The order mandates that the flag be flown at full-staff at the White House, all public buildings, military posts, naval stations, and U.S. embassies worldwide for the entire day. After Inauguration Day, the flag will return to half-staff to honor former President Jimmy Carter, following a previous proclamation for a 30-day mourning period after his death.

## Initial Rescissions Of Harmful Executive Orders And Actions (Presidential Actions January 20, 2025)

On January 20, 2025, a new executive order was issued to revoke several executive actions from the previous administration. The order claims that the previous administration's policies were unpopular, inflationary, illegal, and radical. It criticizes the focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) as corrupting institutions by prioritizing preferential hierarchies over merit and equality. The order also argues that open border policies and climate regulations have harmed American safety and economic stability.

The executive order revokes numerous actions related to racial equity, COVID-19 response, climate change, and other areas. It aims to restore what it describes as "common sense" to the federal government and enhance American prosperity. The heads of federal agencies are instructed to end the implementation of DEI ideologies and review previous actions for potential rescission or replacement. The order emphasizes the need for a thorough review of national security memoranda to ensure they align with American values and security.

The order outlines a process for implementing these changes, including a review by the Domestic Policy Council and the National Economic Council. It also specifies that the order should not interfere with existing legal authorities or create enforceable rights against the U.S. government. The overall goal is to repair institutions and the economy by rolling back what the current administration views as harmful policies from the previous administration.

## Restoring Freedom Of Speech And Ending Federal Censorship (Presidential Actions January 20, 2025)

On January 20, 2025, a new executive order was issued to restore freedom of speech and end federal censorship. This order emphasizes the importance of the First Amendment, which protects the right of Americans to speak freely without government interference. The order criticizes the previous administration for allegedly censoring speech on online platforms by pressuring social media companies to suppress content that did not align with the government's views. It argues that such actions, under the pretense of combating misinformation, violated the free speech rights of American citizens.

The executive order outlines a policy to protect free speech by ensuring that no federal government official or taxpayer resources are used to unconstitutionally limit speech. It also calls for an investigation into past government actions that may have suppressed protected speech, with the Attorney General tasked to report findings and suggest corrective measures. The order aims to prevent any federal department or employee from engaging in activities that contradict these policies.

The order includes provisions to ensure it does not interfere with existing legal authorities or create new legal rights. It stresses that its implementation should align with applicable laws and available funding. The overall goal is to safeguard free speech while addressing past government misconduct related to censorship, ensuring that the government does not overstep its bounds in regulating speech.

## Ending The Weaponization Of The Federal Government (Presidential Actions January 20, 2025)

On January 20, 2025, President Donald Trump issued an executive order aimed at ending what he described as the "weaponization" of the federal government by the previous administration. This order claims that the prior administration used federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies to target political opponents through investigations and prosecutions, actions that were allegedly more about political gain than justice. The order highlights instances where individuals were targeted for protesting or speaking out against the administration, and it criticizes the Department of Justice for its handling of cases related to the January 6 events and Black Lives Matter protests.

The executive order sets a policy to identify and correct past misconduct by federal agencies. It directs the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence to review the activities of federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies over the past four years. They are tasked with identifying any actions that contradict the order's purposes and recommending remedial actions. The order also emphasizes compliance with document-retention policies and legal obligations, with noncompliance referred to the Attorney General.

Overall, the order seeks to ensure accountability for what it describes as the misuse of federal power by the previous administration. It aims to prevent similar actions in the future by reviewing past activities and enforcing compliance with legal standards. However, the order does not create any new legal rights or benefits enforceable against the government.

## Return to In-Person Work (Presidential Actions January 20, 2025)

On January 20, 2025, a memorandum was issued by the executive branch of the U.S. government, directing all department and agency heads to end remote work arrangements and require employees to return to in-person work at their duty stations on a full-time basis. However, the memorandum allows for exemptions if deemed necessary by the department and agency heads. This directive is to be implemented in accordance with applicable laws.

This action aligns with President Donald Trump's stance against remote work, which he had expressed prior to taking office. The order is part of a broader set of executive actions taken by Trump shortly after his inauguration, reflecting his campaign promises and policy priorities. The return to in-person work is expected to face legal challenges, as some federal employees and unions advocate for maintaining remote work options where necessary.

## Regulatory Freeze Pending Review (Presidential Actions January 20, 2025)

On January 20, 2025, the President issued a memorandum to pause and review new regulations. This order applies to all executive departments and agencies, instructing them not to propose or issue any new rules until they are reviewed and approved by a department or agency head appointed by the President. The memorandum also requires the withdrawal of any rules sent to the Office of the Federal Register but not yet published, so they can be reviewed. Additionally, it suggests postponing the effective date of any published rules that have not yet taken effect for 60 days to allow for further review and public comment.

The memorandum defines "rules" broadly, including any regulatory actions or guidance documents that could lead to a final rule or regulation. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director is responsible for overseeing the implementation of this memorandum and can exempt rules necessary for emergencies. The OMB Director can also establish a process to review pending information collections under the Paperwork Reduction Act. If any actions taken before the memorandum's issuance undermine its purpose, the President may modify or extend the memorandum to address those actions.

This regulatory freeze is a common practice for new administrations, allowing them to review and potentially alter the regulatory landscape set by the previous administration. It aims to ensure that new leadership has the opportunity to assess and align regulations with the current administration's priorities. The memorandum emphasizes compliance with existing executive orders on regulatory management and is to be implemented in accordance with applicable laws.

## Hiring Freeze (Presidential Actions January 20, 2025)

On January 20, 2025, the President issued an order to freeze the hiring of federal civilian employees across the executive branch. This means that any vacant federal civilian positions as of noon on that day cannot be filled, and no new positions can be created unless specified by the memorandum or other laws. However, this freeze does not affect military personnel or positions related to immigration enforcement, national security, or public safety. Social Security, Medicare, and Veterans' benefits will not be impacted by this freeze. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) can grant exemptions if necessary.

Within 90 days, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in consultation with the Director of OPM and the Administrator of the United States DOGE Service (USDS), must submit a plan to reduce the federal workforce through efficiency improvements and attrition. Once this plan is issued, the hiring freeze will end for all executive departments and agencies, except for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The freeze for the IRS will continue until the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Director of OMB and the Administrator of USDS, decides it is in the national interest to lift it. The memorandum also prohibits contracting outside the federal government to bypass the freeze.

The memorandum encourages efficient use of existing personnel and funds to improve public services and does not restrict reallocating resources to meet high-priority needs. It also does not limit the appointment of officials to positions requiring Presidential appointment or Senate confirmation, nor does it affect non-career positions or temporary hiring authority. Additionally, it does not override any existing collective bargaining agreements.

## A Plan for Establishing a United States Sovereign Wealth Fund (Presidential Actions February 3, 2025)

On February 3, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order to create a U.S. sovereign wealth fund. The purpose of this fund is to manage the country's wealth for the benefit of American citizens. It aims to ensure long-term financial stability, reduce taxes for families and small businesses, secure economic prosperity for future generations, and enhance the U.S.'s economic and strategic leadership globally. The fund will be developed by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Commerce, who will submit a detailed plan to the President within 90 days. This plan will include strategies for funding, investment, structure, and governance, as well as legal considerations for establishing the fund.

A sovereign wealth fund is a state-owned investment fund that manages a country's financial assets. These funds are typically created from surplus revenues, such as those from natural resources or foreign exchange reserves. They are used to diversify a country's economy and preserve wealth for future generations. The U.S. sovereign wealth fund could potentially be funded by government-owned assets, such as tariffs or other revenues, although the specifics are not yet clear. The fund could invest in various assets, including stocks, bonds, real estate, and infrastructure projects.

The executive order emphasizes that the creation of the sovereign wealth fund should not interfere with existing legal authorities or budgetary functions. It also clarifies that the order does not create any enforceable rights or benefits for individuals against the U.S. government. The establishment of this fund is seen as a significant step towards enhancing the U.S.'s financial health and international influence, although it faces challenges due to the country's existing budget deficit.

## Progress on the Situation at Our Northern Border (Presidential Actions February 3, 2025)

The executive order titled "Progress on the Situation at Our Northern Border" addresses concerns about illegal activities, such as drug trafficking and illegal migration, occurring at the U.S.-Canada border. The President has identified these issues as a significant threat to U.S. national security, foreign policy, and the economy. To counter this threat, the President initially decided to impose tariffs on Canadian goods. However, recognizing Canada's recent efforts to tackle these issues, the implementation of these tariffs has been paused until March 4, 2025, to allow time to assess the effectiveness of Canada's actions.

During this pause, U.S. officials, including the Secretary of Homeland Security and other key advisors, will continue to monitor the situation at the northern border. If the situation worsens or if Canada fails to take adequate measures, the President may decide to enforce the tariffs immediately.

## National Security Presidential Memorandum/NSPM-2 (Presidential Actions February 4, 2025)

The National Security Presidential Memorandum/NSPM-2, issued on February 4, 2025, is an executive order aimed at imposing maximum pressure on Iran to prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons and to counter its influence in the region. The order highlights Iran's history of hostility towards the United States and its allies, its support for terrorist organizations, and its human rights abuses. It emphasizes the need to deny Iran any path to nuclear weapons and to stop its support for terrorism and regional aggression.

The memorandum outlines a comprehensive strategy involving multiple U.S. government departments and agencies. Key actions include imposing and enforcing sanctions, driving Iran's oil exports to zero, and isolating Iran diplomatically. The Secretary of the Treasury is tasked with enforcing sanctions and denying Iran access to revenue, while the Secretary of State is to lead efforts to isolate Iran internationally. The Attorney General is directed to take legal actions against Iranian-sponsored networks and assets in the U.S. and abroad.

Overall, the executive order seeks to use economic, diplomatic, and legal measures to pressure Iran into compliance with international norms and to protect U.S. national security interests. It underscores the U.S. commitment to preventing Iran from developing nuclear capabilities and curbing its support for terrorism and regional destabilization efforts.

## Withdrawing the United States from and Ending Funding to Certain United Nations Organizations and Reviewing United States Support to All International Organizations (Presidential Actions February 4, 2025)

The executive order issued on February 4, 2025, by the U.S. President outlines a significant shift in the United States' involvement with certain United Nations organizations. The order highlights concerns that some UN bodies, such as the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC), the UN Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), have deviated from their original missions and are acting against U.S. interests. As a result, the U.S. will cease participation in the UNHRC and stop funding UNRWA, citing issues such as infiltration by terrorist organizations and anti-Israel sentiment.

The order mandates a review of U.S. membership in UNESCO to assess its alignment with American interests, particularly concerning any anti-Semitic or anti-Israel biases. Additionally, the Secretary of State, in collaboration with the U.S. Ambassador to the UN, is tasked with reviewing all international organizations and treaties the U.S. is involved with to determine if they align with national interests. This review aims to identify organizations that may require reform or from which the U.S. should withdraw.

Furthermore, the executive order instructs that no U.S. funds be used for contributions to UNRWA and the UNHRC. It also requires the Secretary of State to inform relevant UN bodies of the U.S.'s decision to halt funding and participation. This move reflects a broader strategy to reassess and potentially reduce U.S. involvement in international organizations that do not align with its strategic interests.

## Amendment to Duties Addressing the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People’s Republic of China (Presidential Actions February 5, 2025)

On February 5, 2025, the U.S. President issued an executive order amending a previous order from February 1, 2025, which imposed duties on products from China to address the synthetic opioid supply chain. The amendment specifically changes how certain goods are treated under the "de minimis" rule, which allows for duty-free treatment of low-value imports. The amendment states that this duty-free treatment will no longer apply once the Secretary of Commerce confirms that systems are in place to efficiently collect tariffs on these goods.

The executive order aims to combat the flow of synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl, from China to the United States. It highlights the role of Chinese chemical companies and transnational criminal organizations in producing and distributing these drugs. The order is part of a broader strategy to address the opioid crisis, which has been declared a national emergency due to its severe impact on American society.

## Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports (Presidential Actions February 5, 2025)

The executive order titled "Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports," signed on February 5, 2025, by President Trump, aims to ensure that women and girls have fair and safe opportunities to compete in sports. The order emphasizes that allowing men to compete in women's sports is unfair and dangerous, and it violates Title IX, which mandates equal opportunities for women in educational institutions receiving federal funds. The order directs the withdrawal of federal funding from educational programs that allow male participation in women's sports, thereby denying women equal athletic opportunities.

The order outlines specific actions to enforce this policy. It instructs the Secretary of Education to ensure compliance with court orders that vacated previous Title IX regulations and to protect female athletic opportunities by clarifying that women's sports are reserved for women. It also mandates federal agencies to review and potentially rescind funding from non-compliant educational programs. Additionally, the Department of Justice is tasked with providing resources to enforce these policies swiftly.

Furthermore, the order addresses broader sports policies by convening representatives from major athletic organizations and state attorneys general to promote fair and safe policies for female athletes. It also involves international efforts to promote sex-based categories in sports competitions. The order does not create any new legal rights but aims to reinforce existing protections for women in sports.

## Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies (Presidential Actions February 6, 2025)

The executive order issued on February 6, 2025, directs the heads of U.S. executive departments and agencies to review all funding provided to nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). The goal is to ensure that future funding aligns with the interests of the United States and the priorities of the current administration. The administration believes that some NGOs have been using taxpayer dollars in ways that undermine the security, prosperity, and safety of the American people. Therefore, the order aims to stop funding NGOs that are perceived to be against national interests.

The memorandum requires agency heads to make funding decisions based on the administration's goals, applicable laws, and their judgment. This directive is part of a broader effort by the administration to reshape the nonprofit sector and its role both domestically and internationally. Organizations that align ideologically with the administration are expected to face fewer challenges, while those that do not may experience increased scrutiny and potential funding cuts. This could significantly impact NGOs involved in international work, humanitarian aid, and policy advocacy, particularly in areas like climate change, immigration, and equity initiatives. These organizations may need to seek alternative funding sources and adjust their focus to align more closely with the administration's interests.

## Eradicating Anti-Christian Bias (Presidential Actions February 6, 2025)

President Donald Trump issued an executive order on February 6, 2025, aimed at eradicating anti-Christian bias in the United States. The order emphasizes the protection of religious freedoms and addresses concerns about the previous administration's alleged targeting of Christians. It claims that the Biden administration engaged in actions that discriminated against Christians, such as prosecuting peaceful pro-life demonstrators and ignoring violence against Christian institutions. In response, Trump pardoned individuals convicted under these circumstances and condemned the lack of action against anti-Christian violence.

To address these issues, the executive order establishes a Task Force to Eradicate Anti-Christian Bias within the Department of Justice. This task force, chaired by the Attorney General, includes members from various government departments and agencies. Its responsibilities include reviewing past government actions for anti-Christian bias, recommending policy changes, and ensuring the protection of religious liberties. The task force is also tasked with identifying deficiencies in existing laws and suggesting improvements to prevent anti-Christian conduct.

The executive order underscores the administration's commitment to protecting religious freedom and ensuring that Christians can practice their faith without fear of discrimination or retaliation. It aims to rectify past injustices and prevent future anti-Christian bias by enforcing existing laws and potentially recommending new legislative actions. The task force will operate for two years, during which it will report its findings and recommendations to the President.

## Imposing Sanctions on the International Criminal Court (Presidential Actions February 6, 2025)

On February 6, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump issued an executive order imposing sanctions on the International Criminal Court (ICC). The order accuses the ICC of engaging in "illegitimate and baseless actions" against the United States and its ally, Israel. The ICC had issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, accusing them of war crimes during the conflict with Hamas in Gaza. The U.S. and Israel are not members of the ICC, and Trump argues that the court's actions threaten U.S. national security and undermine its sovereignty.

The executive order authorizes economic and travel sanctions against ICC officials involved in investigations against U.S. citizens or allies. This includes freezing assets and blocking entry into the U.S. for those individuals and their families. Trump emphasizes that the U.S. opposes any ICC actions against non-member countries like the U.S. and Israel, and expects its allies to do the same. The order also declares a national emergency to address the perceived threat posed by the ICC's actions.

The sanctions have sparked criticism from international bodies and human rights organizations, who argue that they undermine global accountability for serious crimes. The ICC, which prosecutes individuals for war crimes and crimes against humanity, has vowed to continue its work despite the sanctions. Critics, including Human Rights Watch, warn that the sanctions could hinder the ICC's ability to deliver justice and protect victims of atrocities worldwide.

## President Trump Announces Appointments to the White House Faith Office (Presidential Actions February 7, 2025)

President Donald Trump has announced the establishment of the White House Faith Office, which aims to empower faith-based entities, community organizations, and houses of worship to better serve families and communities. This office will be part of the Domestic Policy Council and will work to ensure that these organizations can compete fairly for federal grants and funding opportunities. The office will also focus on protecting religious liberty and ending religious discrimination by the federal government.

Pastor Paula White-Cain has been appointed as a Senior Advisor to the White House Faith Office. She has a long history of advocating for religious freedom and humanitarian rights and has previously served as an advisor to President Trump. Jennifer S. Korn will serve as the Deputy Assistant to the President and Faith Director, bringing her experience in engaging with various communities during Trump's previous term. Jackson Lane will join as Special Assistant to the President and Deputy Director of Faith Engagement.

The executive order establishing this office also includes a task force to address anti-Christian bias and discrimination within the federal government. This task force, led by Attorney General Pam Bondi, will work to identify and halt any anti-Christian targeting and ensure the protection of religious liberties. The White House Faith Office will consult with faith leaders on policy changes and collaborate with other agencies to support faith-based organizations in obtaining government grants and implementing religious liberty protections.

## Establishment of The White House Faith Office (Presidential Actions February 7, 2025)

On February 7, 2025, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to establish the White House Faith Office. This office is designed to empower faith-based entities, community organizations, and houses of worship to better serve American families and communities. The office will be part of the Domestic Policy Council and will work closely with various government agencies to ensure that these organizations can compete fairly for federal grants and funding opportunities. The executive order emphasizes the importance of religious liberty and aims to eliminate any form of religious discrimination by the federal government.

The White House Faith Office will have several key responsibilities. It will consult with faith and community leaders to gather expertise on various issues, such as protecting women and children, strengthening families, and promoting religious liberty. The office will also make policy recommendations to the President and advise on the implementation of policies that enable faith-based organizations to serve communities more effectively. Additionally, it will coordinate with agencies to provide training and education on religious liberty and help faith-based organizations access government grants.

The executive order also amends previous orders related to faith-based initiatives, renaming the existing White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives to the White House Faith Office. Each federal agency is required to appoint a Faith Liaison to oversee efforts to support the office's mission. The order ensures that the new office operates within the bounds of the law and does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States.

## Protecting Second Amendment Rights (Presidential Actions February 7, 2025)

The executive order titled "Protecting Second Amendment Rights," issued on February 7, 2025, by President Trump, emphasizes the importance of the Second Amendment as a fundamental safeguard of security and liberty in the United States. The order asserts that the right to keep and bear arms is essential for protecting all other rights and should not be infringed. It directs the Attorney General to review all executive actions from January 2021 to January 2025 that might have affected Second Amendment rights and to propose a plan to protect these rights.

The Attorney General is tasked with examining various aspects, including rules from the Department of Justice and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, as well as actions related to firearms regulations and litigation positions that could impact Second Amendment rights. The review aims to identify any ongoing infringements and suggest measures to safeguard these rights. The Attorney General must present a proposed plan of action to the President within 30 days, which will then be finalized and implemented in collaboration with the Domestic Policy Advisor.

This executive order is seen as a move to potentially roll back gun control measures implemented during the Biden administration, including regulations on ghost guns and expanded background checks. It has been praised by gun rights advocates for prioritizing Second Amendment protections but criticized by gun control groups for potentially undermining public safety efforts. The order signals a shift in federal firearms policy, with a focus on enhancing gun rights and reassessing previous regulations.

## Addressing Egregious Actions of The Republic of South Africa (Presidential Actions February 7, 2025)

On February 7, 2025, the U.S. President issued an executive order in response to actions taken by the Republic of South Africa. The order criticizes South Africa's Expropriation Act 13 of 2024, which allows the government to seize land from ethnic minority Afrikaners without compensation. The U.S. views this as a violation of human rights and a continuation of policies that dismantle equal opportunities and fuel violence against certain racial groups. Additionally, South Africa's foreign policy actions, such as its stance against Israel and its relations with Iran, are seen as threats to U.S. national security and foreign policy interests.

The executive order outlines the U.S. policy to halt all aid and assistance to South Africa as long as these practices continue. It also emphasizes support for Afrikaner refugees facing racial discrimination, including property confiscation. U.S. agencies are directed to stop foreign aid to South Africa, with exceptions only if deemed necessary by agency heads. The order also prioritizes the resettlement of Afrikaner refugees in the U.S. through the Refugee Admissions Program.

The order is part of a broader shift in U.S.-South Africa relations, reflecting concerns over South Africa's domestic policies and international alignments. It underscores the U.S. commitment to addressing human rights violations and protecting its national interests, while also highlighting the complexities of South Africa's efforts to address historical land ownership disparities rooted in its apartheid past.

## Gulf of America Day, 2025 (Presidential Actions February 9, 2025)

On February 9, 2025, President Donald Trump proclaimed the day as the first Gulf of America Day. This proclamation follows an executive order he signed on January 20, 2025, which renamed the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. The renaming was part of a broader initiative to restore names that honor American greatness. The area now called the Gulf of America is bordered by the U.S. states of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida, extending to the boundaries with Mexico and Cuba.

The renaming was justified by the President as a way to acknowledge the Gulf's historical significance to the United States. Trump emphasized that the Gulf has been a crucial asset to the nation and remains an integral part of America's identity. The proclamation of Gulf of America Day is intended to foster national pride and encourage Americans to celebrate this change with various programs and activities.

President Trump called upon public officials and citizens to observe Gulf of America Day with appropriate ceremonies and activities. This move is part of his administration's efforts to promote American pride and commemorate historical changes that reflect the nation's values and heritage.

## Ending Procurement and Forced Use of Paper Straws (Presidential Actions February 10, 2025)

On February 10, 2025, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to stop the federal government from buying and using paper straws. The order argues that paper straws are less effective, more expensive, and potentially harmful to health due to the chemicals used in their production. It also points out that paper straws often come wrapped in plastic, which contradicts the environmental benefits they are supposed to offer. The order aims to reverse previous policies that discouraged the use of plastic straws, which Trump had revoked earlier in January 2025.

The executive order directs federal agencies to stop purchasing paper straws and to remove any policies that disfavor plastic straws. Within 45 days, a national strategy is to be developed to end the use of paper straws, addressing policies that ban or penalize plastic straws and exploring other methods to implement this policy nationwide. This move is part of a broader effort to promote the use of plastic straws over paper ones, citing concerns over the functionality and environmental impact of paper straws.

The order also includes general provisions to ensure it does not interfere with existing legal authorities or budgetary processes. It clarifies that the order does not create any enforceable rights or benefits for individuals against the U.S. government. This decision has sparked debate, with environmental groups criticizing the move for potentially increasing plastic waste, while the plastics industry has welcomed it as a practical solution.

## Eliminating the Federal Executive Institute (Presidential Actions February 10, 2025)

On February 10, 2025, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to eliminate the Federal Executive Institute (FEI), a government program established over 50 years ago to provide leadership training for federal bureaucrats. The decision is part of a broader effort to reduce government inefficiency and ensure that taxpayer dollars are used effectively. The administration believes that the FEI has contributed to the growth of a bureaucratic class in Washington, D.C., which does not directly benefit American families or align with national interests.

The executive order directs the Office of Personnel Management to take all necessary steps to close the FEI and revokes previous documents that established or required its existence. This move is consistent with the administration's policy to eliminate government programs that do not provide measurable benefits to the American people. The order emphasizes that the government should focus on serving taxpayers and upholding the Constitution rather than maintaining a large federal bureaucracy.

While the closure of the FEI is intended to cut wasteful spending, some critics argue that leadership training is essential for effective government operations. The FEI has been a valuable resource for developing leadership skills among federal employees, and its elimination raises questions about how the government will continue to train and develop its workforce. The administration has not yet provided a detailed plan for how it will address these concerns or what alternative training programs might be implemented.

## Pausing Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Enforcement to Further American Economic and National Security (Presidential Actions February 10, 2025)

On February 10, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order to pause the enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) for 180 days. The order argues that the FCPA has been overextended and misused, negatively impacting U.S. interests and foreign policy objectives. The President believes that the current enforcement of the FCPA hinders American companies' global competitiveness and, consequently, national security. The order aims to reduce barriers to American commerce abroad by reviewing and potentially revising the guidelines for FCPA enforcement.

During this 180-day period, the Attorney General is instructed to stop initiating new FCPA investigations unless an exception is warranted. The Attorney General will also review existing investigations to ensure they align with the President's foreign policy goals and issue updated guidelines to promote American economic interests. The review period can be extended for another 180 days if necessary. After the new guidelines are issued, any ongoing or new FCPA actions must be specifically authorized by the Attorney General.

The executive order emphasizes the need to prioritize American economic competitiveness and efficient use of federal resources. It reflects a shift in focus towards protecting U.S. companies from what is perceived as excessive and unpredictable enforcement of the FCPA. However, it is important to note that bribery remains illegal, and companies should continue to maintain compliance programs to adhere to anti-corruption laws both domestically and internationally.

## Adjusting Imports of Steel into The United States (Presidential Actions February 10, 2025)

The executive order issued on February 10, 2025, by President Trump focuses on adjusting the imports of steel into the United States to protect national security. Initially, in 2018, a 25% tariff was imposed on steel imports from most countries to address the threat posed by excessive steel imports to U.S. national security. Over time, some countries were exempted or given alternative arrangements, but these have not been effective in reducing the threat. As a result, the order terminates these exemptions and arrangements, reinstating the 25% tariff on steel imports from countries like Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, the EU, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, the UK, and Ukraine, effective March 12, 2025.

The order also highlights the failure of alternative agreements with certain countries to adequately address the issues of excess steel capacity and unfair trading practices, particularly those involving China. The increased imports from exempted countries have negatively impacted the U.S. steel industry, leading to depressed performance and capacity utilization rates below the desired 80%. The proclamation aims to ensure that the domestic steel industry can sustain its production capacity and protect national security by reapplying the tariffs universally.

Additionally, the order addresses the issue of derivative steel products, which have been used to circumvent the tariffs. It expands the scope of the tariffs to include more derivative steel articles and terminates the product exclusion process that allowed certain imports to bypass the tariffs. This comprehensive approach is intended to strengthen the U.S. steel industry and prevent further impairment of national security by ensuring that all steel imports are subject to the same tariff conditions.

## Implementing The President’s “Department of Government Efficiency” Workforce Optimization Initiative (Presidential Actions February 11, 2025)

The executive order titled "Implementing The President’s 'Department of Government Efficiency' Workforce Optimization Initiative" aims to transform the federal bureaucracy by reducing waste and inefficiency. The order introduces measures to shrink the federal workforce, requiring agencies to hire no more than one new employee for every four that leave, except in areas related to public safety, immigration enforcement, or law enforcement. This initiative is part of a broader effort to make the government more accountable and efficient, ultimately benefiting American families, workers, and taxpayers.

To achieve these goals, the order mandates agency heads to develop data-driven hiring plans in consultation with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) Team Leads. These plans should focus on filling positions in high-need areas and require approval from DOGE Team Leads before hiring decisions are made. Additionally, the order calls for large-scale reductions in force (RIFs), prioritizing non-essential functions and diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is tasked with revising federal hiring suitability criteria to ensure high standards of conduct among federal employees.

The order also includes provisions for agency reorganization, requiring agency heads to report on statutory requirements and consider eliminating or consolidating subcomponents. Exemptions are allowed for positions necessary for national security, homeland security, or public safety. The order emphasizes that it should be implemented in accordance with applicable laws and does not create any enforceable rights or benefits. Overall, this executive order seeks to streamline the federal workforce and improve government efficiency through strategic hiring and organizational restructuring.

## President Trump Announces the President’s Intelligence Advisory Board (Presidential Actions February 11, 2025)

President Donald J. Trump announced the formation of the President’s Intelligence Advisory Board (PIAB) on February 11, 2025. This board is composed of a group of individuals who are considered distinguished and trusted patriots. Their main role is to advise the President on critical national security challenges and ensure that the Intelligence Community aligns with the President's "America First" agenda. The board members are selected for their diverse experience and intellect, which are expected to help restore integrity within the Intelligence Community.

The appointed members of the PIAB include Devin Gerald Nunes as the Chair, along with Scott Glabe, Amaryllis Fox Kennedy, Brad Robert Wenstrup, Wayne Berman, Reince Priebus, Robert O’Brien, Joshua Lobel, Sander R. Gerber, Katie Miller, Jeremy Katz, and Thomas Ollis Hicks, Jr. These individuals bring a wide range of expertise and perspectives to the board, which is intended to enhance the effectiveness and accountability of the Intelligence Community in addressing the nation's security issues.

## Adjusting Imports of Aluminum into The United States (Presidential Actions February 11, 2025)

In this executive order, the U.S. President addresses the issue of aluminum imports, which are seen as a threat to national security. Initially, a 10% tariff was imposed on aluminum imports in 2018 to protect domestic industries. However, this measure has not been effective enough due to global excess capacity, particularly from China, and loopholes that allowed some countries to avoid these tariffs. As a result, domestic aluminum production has suffered, with decreased production and facility closures.

To counter these issues, the President has decided to increase the tariff on aluminum imports from 10% to 25%. This increase aims to better protect the U.S. aluminum industry by making foreign aluminum more expensive and less competitive in the U.S. market. Additionally, the order terminates previous agreements with countries like Argentina, Australia, Canada, Mexico, the EU, and the UK, which had allowed them to avoid these tariffs. These countries will now be subject to the same 25% tariff as other nations.

The executive order also addresses the problem of derivative aluminum products, which have been used to circumvent tariffs. It expands the tariffs to include these products and ends the process that allowed for product exclusions. This comprehensive approach is intended to close loopholes and ensure that the tariffs effectively support the U.S. aluminum industry, aiming for a production capacity utilization of at least 80%, which is considered necessary for national security.

## One Voice for America’s Foreign Relations (Presidential Actions February 12, 2025)

The executive order titled "One Voice for America’s Foreign Relations" emphasizes the President's authority over U.S. foreign policy, as granted by Article II of the Constitution. It mandates that all government officials involved in foreign policy must act under the President's direction. The Secretary of State is tasked with ensuring that the workforce implementing foreign policy is effective and loyal to the President's agenda. Failure to comply with these directives can lead to disciplinary actions, including termination.

The order outlines specific definitions for terms related to the Foreign Service and Civil Service employees, ensuring clarity in its application. It also grants the Secretary of State the discretion to take necessary personnel actions when employees fail to meet performance standards. The Secretary is responsible for reforming the Foreign Service to align with the President's foreign policy goals, including revising recruitment, evaluation, and training processes.

Finally, the order clarifies that it does not override existing legal authorities or create new legal rights. It must be implemented in accordance with applicable laws and budgetary constraints. This ensures that the order respects the legal framework and does not infringe on the powers of other branches of government or existing laws.
