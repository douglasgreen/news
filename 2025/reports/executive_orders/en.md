It aims to restore what it describes as "common sense" to the federal government and enhance American prosperity. The heads of federal agencies are instructed to end the implementation of DEI ideologies and review previous actions for potential rescission or replacement. The order emphasizes the need for a thorough review of national security memoranda to ensure they align with American values and security.

The order outlines a process for implementing these changes, including a review by the Domestic Policy Council and the National Economic Council.

## Restoring Freedom Of Speech And Ending Federal Censorship (Presidential Actions January 20, 2025)

This order claims that the prior administration used federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies to target political opponents through investigations and prosecutions, actions that were allegedly more about political gain than justice. The order highlights instances where individuals were targeted for protesting or speaking out against the administration, and it criticizes the Department of Justice for its handling of cases related to the January 6 events and Black Lives Matter protests.

The executive order sets a policy to identify and correct past misconduct by federal agencies.

They are tasked with identifying any actions that contradict the order's purposes and recommending remedial actions.

However, the memorandum allows for exemptions if deemed necessary by the department and agency heads. This directive is to be implemented in accordance with applicable laws.

This action aligns with President Donald Trump's stance against remote work, which he had expressed prior to taking office.

## Regulatory Freeze Pending Review (Presidential Actions January 20, 2025)

On January 20, 2025, the President issued a memorandum to pause and review new regulations. This order applies to all executive departments and agencies, instructing them not to propose or issue any new rules until they are reviewed and approved by a department or agency head appointed by the President. The memorandum also requires the withdrawal of any rules sent to the Office of the Federal Register but not yet published, so they can be reviewed. Additionally, it suggests postponing the effective date of any published rules that have not yet taken effect for 60 days to allow for further review and public comment.

The memorandum defines "rules" broadly, including any regulatory actions or guidance documents that could lead to a final rule or regulation. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director is responsible for overseeing the implementation of this memorandum and can exempt rules necessary for emergencies. The OMB Director can also establish a process to review pending information collections under the Paperwork Reduction Act. If any actions taken before the memorandum's issuance undermine its purpose, the President may modify or extend the memorandum to address those actions.

This regulatory freeze is a common practice for new administrations, allowing them to review and potentially alter the regulatory landscape set by the previous administration. It aims to ensure that new leadership has the opportunity to assess and align regulations with the current administration's priorities. The memorandum emphasizes compliance with existing executive orders on regulatory management and is to be implemented in accordance with applicable laws.

## Hiring Freeze (Presidential Actions January 20, 2025)

On January 20, 2025, the President issued an order to freeze the hiring of federal civilian employees across the executive branch. This means that any vacant federal civilian positions as of noon on that day cannot be filled, and no new positions can be created unless specified by the memorandum or other laws. However, this freeze does not affect military personnel or positions related to immigration enforcement, national security, or public safety. Social Security, Medicare, and Veterans' benefits will not be impacted by this freeze. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) can grant exemptions if necessary.

Within 90 days, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in consultation with the Director of OPM and the Administrator of the United States DOGE Service (USDS), must submit a plan to reduce the federal workforce through efficiency improvements and attrition. Once this plan is issued, the hiring freeze will end for all executive departments and agencies, except for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The freeze for the IRS will continue until the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Director of OMB and the Administrator of USDS, decides it is in the national interest to lift it. The memorandum also prohibits contracting outside the federal government to bypass the freeze.

The memorandum encourages efficient use of existing personnel and funds to improve public services and does not restrict reallocating resources to meet high-priority needs. It also does not limit the appointment of officials to positions requiring Presidential appointment or Senate confirmation, nor does it affect non-career positions or temporary hiring authority. Additionally, it does not override any existing collective bargaining agreements.

## Delivering Emergency Price Relief for American Families and Defeating the Cost-of-Living Crisis (Presidential Actions January 20, 2025)

President Trump has issued a directive aimed at providing emergency price relief to American families to combat the cost-of-living crisis. This directive criticizes the previous Biden Administration for causing inflation through excessive government spending and regulations that limited the availability of essential goods and services. The directive highlights the increased costs of energy, housing, and other necessities, attributing these to regulatory burdens and policies that have weakened American production.

To address these issues, the directive orders executive departments and agencies to take actions to lower housing costs, reduce healthcare expenses, and eliminate regulations that increase the cost of home appliances. It also aims to create more job opportunities and remove policies that raise food and fuel prices. The Assistant to the President for Economic Policy is tasked with reporting on the progress of these initiatives every 30 days.

The directive emphasizes the need to restore purchasing power and improve the quality of life for American families. However, it has been noted that the directive lacks specific policy changes and concrete actions, relying instead on broad instructions to executive agencies. The focus is on reducing regulatory costs and expanding housing supply, but the details on how these goals will be achieved remain vague.

## Putting America First In International Environmental Agreements (Presidential Actions January 20, 2025)

It also revokes the U.S. International Climate Finance Plan and requires various federal agencies to report on their actions to rescind policies supporting this plan. The order further directs that future international energy agreements prioritize economic efficiency and American prosperity.

This move marks a significant shift in U.S. international environmental policy, focusing on reducing perceived economic burdens from global climate agreements. The decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement may impact international relations and the global climate initiative's viability. It reflects the administration's broader strategy to enhance American energy dominance and reconsider regulations affecting domestic energy production.

Some viewed it as an abuse of power and a dangerous precedent, while others saw it as a necessary step towards healing the nation. The pardons were met with criticism from various political figures and organizations, including law enforcement groups and members of both political parties.

## Application Of Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act To TikTok (Presidential Actions January 20, 2025)

The executive order issued on January 20, 2025, by the President of the United States addresses the application of the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act to TikTok. This Act aims to regulate applications controlled by foreign adversaries, specifically targeting TikTok and its parent company, ByteDance Ltd., due to national security concerns. The Act prohibits the distribution, maintenance, or updating of such applications within the U.S. through online stores or hosting services. These prohibitions took effect on January 19, 2025, just before the new President took office.

The President has expressed concerns about the timing of the Act's enforcement, which interferes with the ability to assess its national security implications and negotiate a resolution to prevent TikTok's abrupt shutdown. To address this, the President has ordered a 75-day pause on enforcing the Act, allowing time to evaluate the situation and determine a suitable course of action. During this period, the Department of Justice will not enforce the Act or impose penalties for noncompliance. The Attorney General is instructed to issue guidance and letters to providers, ensuring no liability for actions taken during this pause.

The executive order emphasizes the President's responsibility for national security and foreign policy, highlighting the need for a careful review of TikTok's impact on national security. The order also asserts the exclusive authority of the Executive Branch to enforce the Act, preventing states or private parties from attempting enforcement. This pause aims to balance national security concerns with the continued availability of a platform used by millions of Americans.

## Withdrawing The United States From The World Health Organization (Presidential Actions January 20, 2025)

On January 20, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order to withdraw the United States from the World Health Organization (WHO). This decision was based on criticisms of the WHO's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and other global health crises, as well as concerns about the organization's political independence and financial demands on the U.S. The order revokes previous actions that had retracted the U.S.'s withdrawal notice and calls for halting U.S. funding and support to the WHO, recalling U.S. personnel, and finding alternative partners to take over WHO's roles.

The executive order outlines several actions, including revoking a previous executive order related to COVID-19 response and establishing new mechanisms within the National Security Council to protect public health. It also directs the Secretary of State to notify the United Nations and WHO leadership of the withdrawal and to stop negotiations on the WHO Pandemic Agreement. The order emphasizes that it should not affect existing legal authorities or create enforceable rights against the U.S. government.

The withdrawal from WHO could have significant implications for global health and U.S. influence in international health matters. The U.S. has been a major contributor to WHO, providing financial support and technical expertise. Without U.S. involvement, there may be challenges in global health coordination, disease surveillance, and response to health emergencies. The decision also reflects a broader shift in U.S. foreign policy towards a more unilateral approach.

## Restoring Accountability To Policy-Influencing Positions Within the Federal Workforce (Presidential Actions January 20, 2025)

On January 20, 2025, an executive order was issued to restore accountability in policy-influencing positions within the federal workforce. The order highlights the President's authority over the executive branch and emphasizes the need for professionalism and accountability among federal employees, especially those in positions that influence policy. It points out that many supervisors lack confidence in their ability to remove employees for misconduct or poor performance, which undermines accountability. The order reinstates a previous policy, known as Schedule F, which reclassifies certain federal employees to make it easier to remove them if they do not align with the administration's policies.

The executive order makes several amendments to the previous policy, renaming Schedule F to Schedule Policy/Career and specifying that employees in these positions must implement administration policies faithfully, regardless of personal or political beliefs. The order also revokes a previous executive order that protected federal workforce rights and directs the Office of Personnel Management to amend regulations that conflict with the new order. Additionally, it requires the identification of more positions that should be considered for the new classification, aiming to ensure that those in policy-influencing roles are directly accountable to the President.

Overall, the executive order seeks to streamline the process of holding federal employees accountable, particularly those in influential positions, by reinstating and modifying a previous policy. It aims to ensure that these employees are aligned with the administration's goals and can be removed if they fail to implement policies effectively. This move has sparked debate about the potential for increased political influence over traditionally apolitical civil service roles.

## Holding Former Government Officials Accountable For Election Interference And Improper Disclosure Of Sensitive Governmental Information (Presidential Actions January 20, 2025)

On January 20, 2025, an executive order was issued to hold former government officials accountable for election interference and improper disclosure of sensitive information. This order was a response to actions taken during the 2020 Presidential campaign, where 51 former intelligence officials coordinated with the Biden campaign to discredit a news story about President Biden's son. The letter they issued falsely suggested the story was Russian disinformation, and it was reviewed by the CIA before publication. This misuse of intelligence authority was seen as a breach of trust and an attempt to manipulate the political process.

The executive order also addressed the issue of classified information being disclosed for personal gain. Former National Security Advisor John R. Bolton published a memoir containing sensitive information, which was seen as undermining national security and the ability of future presidents to receive candid advice. To address these issues, the order revoked the security clearances of the involved former intelligence officials and John R. Bolton. It emphasized that the Intelligence Community should not engage in partisan politics or use security clearances to influence elections.

The order directed the Director of National Intelligence and the CIA to revoke the clearances of specific individuals and report any further inappropriate activities within 90 days. It also outlined policies to prevent future misuse of intelligence for political purposes and the improper disclosure of classified information. The order aimed to restore trust in the Intelligence Community and ensure that national security information is handled responsibly.

## Declaring A National Emergency At The Southern Border Of The United States (Presidential Actions January 20, 2025)

He cited threats from cartels, criminal gangs, terrorists, human traffickers, and smugglers as reasons for this action. The proclamation states that these threats have caused chaos and suffering in the U.S., leading to deaths from drug overdoses and violence. To address this, the President has ordered the use of the U.S. Armed Forces to support the Department of Homeland Security in securing the border.

The proclamation outlines several actions to be taken. It directs the deployment of military personnel and resources to assist in controlling the border. This includes constructing additional physical barriers and using unmanned aerial systems to monitor the area. The proclamation also calls for revising policies to prevent unauthorized entry and ensure the safety of law enforcement and military personnel. Additionally, it revokes a previous proclamation that terminated the emergency status and redirected funds for border wall construction.

## Memorandum to Resolve the Backlog of Security Clearances for Executive Office of the President Personnel (Presidential Actions January 20, 2025)

The memorandum addresses a backlog in processing security clearances for personnel in the Executive Office of the President, which has been causing delays in their ability to perform their duties. This backlog was created during the Biden Administration and has resulted in some individuals being unable to access necessary facilities and technology. To resolve this issue, the President has ordered that certain personnel be granted interim Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) security clearances for up to six months. This will allow them immediate access to the resources they need to fulfill their roles.

The White House Counsel is tasked with providing a list of these individuals to the White House Security Office and Acting Chief Security Officer. The Counsel also has the authority to add more names to this list as needed and can revoke any interim clearances if necessary.

Overall, this action aims to expedite the security clearance process for essential personnel, ensuring that they can carry out their responsibilities without unnecessary delays. The President is using his authority to bypass the traditional, slower clearance procedures temporarily, highlighting the importance of efficiency in government operations.

Overall, the memorandum aims to strengthen U.S. trade policies by promoting investment, productivity, and technological advantages while protecting American workers and businesses.

The order also seeks to eliminate mandates and subsidies that favor electric vehicles, promoting consumer choice and competition in the market.

The executive order calls for a review of existing regulations that may hinder domestic energy development, with a focus on oil, natural gas, coal, and other resources. It revokes several previous executive orders related to climate change and environmental regulations, aiming to streamline the permitting process for energy projects. The order also disbands the Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases, criticizing its methodologies and impact on regulatory decisions. Additionally, it pauses funding for green energy projects under the Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, pending a review to ensure alignment with the new policy goals.

## Realigning the United States Refugee Admissions Program (Presidential Actions January 20, 2025)

On January 20, 2025, an executive order was issued to realign the United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP). This order suspends the program due to the high levels of migration that have overwhelmed various U.S. cities and towns. The suspension aims to ensure that the entry of refugees aligns with the national interests, focusing on public safety, national security, and the proper assimilation of refugees. The order also emphasizes the need to preserve resources for American citizens and suggests that state and local governments should have a say in refugee placements within their jurisdictions.

The executive order mandates that the entry of refugees under the USRAP is halted until further notice, with exceptions allowed on a case-by-case basis if deemed in the national interest.

Additionally, the order revokes a previous executive order from 2021 that aimed to enhance the refugee program and address climate change-related migration.

This suspension of the USRAP represents a significant shift in U.S. refugee policy, potentially delaying future refugee arrivals and altering the longstanding federal authority over refugee admissions. The order underscores the importance of involving state and local jurisdictions in resettlement decisions, which could lead to changes in how refugees are placed across the country. The overall goal is to ensure that refugee admissions do not compromise the safety, security, and resources of American communities.

## Protecting The Meaning And Value Of American Citizenship (Presidential Actions January 20, 2025)

On January 20, 2025, an executive order was issued to redefine the criteria for birthright citizenship in the United States. The order emphasizes that U.S. citizenship is a valuable privilege and aims to restrict automatic citizenship for certain individuals born in the U.S. Specifically, it targets children born to mothers who are either unlawfully present in the U.S. or temporarily present (such as on a tourist or student visa) if the father is not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident. This order seeks to ensure that citizenship is not automatically granted in these cases, aligning with a specific interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment.

The policy outlined in the executive order prevents federal agencies from issuing or recognizing documents that confer U.S. citizenship to individuals falling under the specified categories. This policy is set to apply to individuals born in the U.S. after 30 days from the order's issuance. However, it does not affect the citizenship rights of children born to lawful permanent residents. The order also mandates that relevant government departments align their regulations and policies with this new directive and provide public guidance on its implementation.

This executive order has sparked legal challenges, with critics arguing that it contradicts the Fourteenth Amendment, which has historically granted citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil, regardless of their parents' immigration status. Legal actions have been taken to block the order, with courts issuing preliminary injunctions to prevent its implementation. The controversy centers around the interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment and the potential implications for children born in the U.S. under the new criteria.

## Securing Our Borders (Presidential Actions January 20, 2025)

The order emphasizes the need to protect the nation by stopping illegal immigration and the flow of illicit materials across the border. It outlines a policy to use all available resources to secure the borders, including building physical barriers, detaining illegal immigrants, and cooperating with state and local law enforcement.

The order specifies several actions to achieve these goals. It calls for the construction of physical barriers along the southern border and the deployment of personnel to ensure control. It also mandates the detention of illegal immigrants until they are removed from the country and the resumption of the Migrant Protection Protocols. Additionally, it seeks to adjust parole policies and enhance international cooperation to manage immigration more effectively. The order also includes measures to prioritize the prosecution of border-related offenses and to ensure the use of DNA and identification technologies for detained individuals.

Overall, the executive order aims to strengthen border security and enforce immigration laws more strictly. It seeks to address the challenges posed by illegal immigration by implementing a comprehensive approach that includes physical barriers, increased personnel, and legal measures. The order underscores the importance of protecting national security and public safety by controlling the borders and managing immigration effectively.

## Putting People Over Fish: Stopping Radical Environmentalism to Provide Water to Southern California (Presidential Actions January 20, 2025)

President Trump issued a memorandum directing the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Interior to restart efforts from his previous administration to redirect water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to Central and Southern California. This action aims to provide a more reliable water supply to these regions, which have been affected by wildfires and water scarcity. The memorandum criticizes previous environmental regulations that protected fish species like the Delta smelt, arguing that these rules have led to water being wasted by flowing into the Pacific Ocean instead of being used for human needs.

During Trump's first term, California's government opposed his water infrastructure plans, citing environmental concerns. The recent memorandum emphasizes the need to prioritize human water needs over environmental protections, especially in light of the destructive wildfires in Southern California. Trump has given the Secretaries 90 days to report on the progress of implementing these policies and to provide recommendations for future actions.

The memorandum has sparked controversy, with environmental groups and some officials arguing that it overlooks the ecological importance of the Delta and its species. Critics also point out that the current water management rules, developed under the Biden and Newsom administrations, aim to balance water distribution while protecting the environment. These rules reportedly provide more water to Southern California than Trump's previous regulations. The debate highlights ongoing tensions between environmental conservation and resource management in California.

The order criticizes previous actions by politicians and judges, particularly those by President Biden, who had placed a moratorium on federal executions and commuted the sentences of several individuals on death row. The order argues that such actions undermine justice and the laws of the United States, which have historically supported capital punishment for the most heinous crimes.

The order outlines several directives for the Attorney General, including pursuing the death penalty for severe crimes, especially those involving the murder of law enforcement officers or crimes committed by illegal aliens. It also calls for efforts to overturn Supreme Court precedents that limit the use of capital punishment and to ensure states have the necessary resources to carry out executions. Additionally, the order emphasizes the need for coordination between federal and state law enforcement to protect communities from violent crime.

Overall, the executive order seeks to reinforce the use of the death penalty in the United States, counteracting previous efforts to limit its application. It highlights the administration's commitment to upholding laws that authorize capital punishment and ensuring that justice is served for victims of violent crimes. The order also addresses logistical aspects, such as ensuring the availability of drugs for lethal injections and evaluating the conditions of confinement for those whose sentences were commuted.

## Promoting Beautiful Federal Civic Architecture (Presidential Actions January 20, 2025)

The memorandum issued on January 20, 2025, directs the Administrator of the General Services Administration (GSA) to work with the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and other relevant department heads to propose recommendations within 60 days. These recommendations aim to ensure that federal public buildings are easily recognizable as civic structures and honor regional, traditional, and classical architectural styles. The goal is to enhance public spaces and reflect the dignity of the United States and its governance system. The recommendations should also consider revising the Guiding Principles for Federal Architecture and include community input in the design process.

If the GSA Administrator plans to approve a design for a new federal building that does not align with this policy before the recommendations are submitted, they must notify the President at least 30 days in advance. This notification should explain why the design is being considered, allowing time for potential rejection without incurring significant costs. This approach emphasizes the importance of maintaining architectural standards that resonate with the public and uphold the nation's values.

## Restoring Accountability for Career Senior Executives (Presidential Actions January 20, 2025)

The memorandum from January 20, 2025, focuses on ensuring that Career Senior Executive Service (SES) officials are held accountable for their roles in the U.S. government. These officials have significant influence over government operations and must align with the President's agenda to ensure the laws are executed faithfully. The President has the authority to remove SES officials if they fail to meet their responsibilities, such as unauthorized disclosures or inefficient performance.

To enhance accountability, the memorandum outlines several actions. Within 30 days, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) must issue performance plans for SES officials. Agency heads are instructed to use their authority to prioritize accountability, reassign SES members to align with the President's agenda, and restructure existing boards to ensure performance evaluations are enforced. If an SES official's performance is inconsistent with their duties, agency heads must take appropriate actions, including removal.

Overall, the memorandum emphasizes the importance of a responsive and accountable government workforce. It aims to restore a government that serves the people by ensuring that SES officials are effectively managed and held accountable for their performance, aligning with the President's goals and the nation's needs.

## Declaring a National Energy Emergency (Presidential Actions January 20, 2025)

On January 20, 2025, the President declared a national energy emergency due to the United States' inadequate energy supply and infrastructure. This situation has led to high energy prices, affecting Americans, especially those with low incomes. The emergency declaration aims to address these issues by enhancing domestic energy production and infrastructure, reducing reliance on foreign energy, and improving national security. The order emphasizes the need for a reliable and affordable energy supply to support various sectors, including manufacturing, transportation, and defense.

The executive order directs federal agencies to use all available legal authorities to expedite energy projects and infrastructure development. This includes identifying and utilizing domestic energy resources, facilitating energy transportation and refining, and addressing vulnerabilities in the energy sector. The order also calls for emergency fuel waivers and the use of emergency provisions under environmental laws to support energy supply. The goal is to create jobs, improve the trade balance, and strengthen international relations by leveraging the United States' energy resources.

Additionally, the order outlines specific actions for federal agencies, such as assessing the Department of Defense's energy needs and vulnerabilities, and coordinating infrastructure assistance. It also includes provisions for emergency consultations under the Endangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act to facilitate energy projects. The overall aim is to ensure the United States can meet its energy demands, maintain technological innovation, and protect national security.

## Temporary Withdrawal of All Areas on the Outer Continental Shelf from Offshore Wind Leasing and Review of the Federal Government’s Leasing and Permitting Practices for Wind Projects (Presidential Actions January 20, 2025)

On January 20, 2025, a memorandum was issued to temporarily stop all new or renewed offshore wind energy leasing on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). This decision aims to ensure responsible management of public resources, considering factors like energy needs, marine life, and the fishing industry. The memorandum does not affect existing leases but requires a review of their ecological and economic impacts. This pause will remain until the memorandum is revoked.

Additionally, the memorandum calls for a comprehensive review of federal wind leasing and permitting practices due to potential legal and environmental issues. This review will assess the impact of wind projects on wildlife and the economic costs of wind energy. During this review, no new approvals or permits for wind projects will be issued. The memorandum also addresses concerns about the Lava Ridge Wind Project, placing a temporary halt on related activities and requiring further analysis of its impacts.

## A Plan for Establishing a United States Sovereign Wealth Fund (Presidential Actions February 3, 2025)

On February 3, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order to create a U.S. sovereign wealth fund. The purpose of this fund is to manage the country's wealth for the benefit of American citizens. It aims to ensure long-term financial stability, reduce taxes for families and small businesses, secure economic prosperity for future generations, and enhance the U.S.'s economic and strategic leadership globally. The fund will be developed by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Commerce, who will submit a detailed plan to the President within 90 days. This plan will include strategies for funding, investment, structure, and governance, as well as legal considerations for establishing the fund.

A sovereign wealth fund is a state-owned investment fund that manages a country's financial assets. These funds are typically created from surplus revenues, such as those from natural resources or foreign exchange reserves. They are used to diversify a country's economy and preserve wealth for future generations. The U.S. sovereign wealth fund could potentially be funded by government-owned assets, such as tariffs or other revenues, although the specifics are not yet clear. The fund could invest in various assets, including stocks, bonds, real estate, and infrastructure projects.

The executive order emphasizes that the creation of the sovereign wealth fund should not interfere with existing legal authorities or budgetary functions. The establishment of this fund is seen as a significant step towards enhancing the U.S.'s financial health and international influence, although it faces challenges due to the country's existing budget deficit.

## Progress on the Situation at Our Northern Border (Presidential Actions February 3, 2025)

The executive order titled "Progress on the Situation at Our Northern Border" addresses concerns about illegal activities, such as drug trafficking and illegal migration, occurring at the U.S.-Canada border. The President has identified these issues as a significant threat to U.S. national security, foreign policy, and the economy. To counter this threat, the President initially decided to impose tariffs on Canadian goods. However, recognizing Canada's recent efforts to tackle these issues, the implementation of these tariffs has been paused until March 4, 2025, to allow time to assess the effectiveness of Canada's actions.

During this pause, U.S. officials, including the Secretary of Homeland Security and other key advisors, will continue to monitor the situation at the northern border. If the situation worsens or if Canada fails to take adequate measures, the President may decide to enforce the tariffs immediately.

## National Security Presidential Memorandum/NSPM-2 (Presidential Actions February 4, 2025)

The National Security Presidential Memorandum/NSPM-2, issued on February 4, 2025, is an executive order aimed at imposing maximum pressure on Iran to prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons and to counter its influence in the region. The order highlights Iran's history of hostility towards the United States and its allies, its support for terrorist organizations, and its human rights abuses. It emphasizes the need to deny Iran any path to nuclear weapons and to stop its support for terrorism and regional aggression.

The memorandum outlines a comprehensive strategy involving multiple U.S. government departments and agencies. Key actions include imposing and enforcing sanctions, driving Iran's oil exports to zero, and isolating Iran diplomatically. The Secretary of the Treasury is tasked with enforcing sanctions and denying Iran access to revenue, while the Secretary of State is to lead efforts to isolate Iran internationally. The Attorney General is directed to take legal actions against Iranian-sponsored networks and assets in the U.S. and abroad.

Overall, the executive order seeks to use economic, diplomatic, and legal measures to pressure Iran into compliance with international norms and to protect U.S. national security interests. It underscores the U.S. commitment to preventing Iran from developing nuclear capabilities and curbing its support for terrorism and regional destabilization efforts.

## Withdrawing the United States from and Ending Funding to Certain United Nations Organizations and Reviewing United States Support to All International Organizations (Presidential Actions February 4, 2025)

The executive order issued on February 4, 2025, by the U.S. President outlines a significant shift in the United States' involvement with certain United Nations organizations. The order highlights concerns that some UN bodies, such as the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC), the UN Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), have deviated from their original missions and are acting against U.S. interests. As a result, the U.S. will cease participation in the UNHRC and stop funding UNRWA, citing issues such as infiltration by terrorist organizations and anti-Israel sentiment.

The order mandates a review of U.S. membership in UNESCO to assess its alignment with American interests, particularly concerning any anti-Semitic or anti-Israel biases. Additionally, the Secretary of State, in collaboration with the U.S. Ambassador to the UN, is tasked with reviewing all international organizations and treaties the U.S. is involved with to determine if they align with national interests. This review aims to identify organizations that may require reform or from which the U.S. should withdraw.

Furthermore, the executive order instructs that no U.S. funds be used for contributions to UNRWA and the UNHRC. It also requires the Secretary of State to inform relevant UN bodies of the U.S.'s decision to halt funding and participation. This move reflects a broader strategy to reassess and potentially reduce U.S. involvement in international organizations that do not align with its strategic interests.

## Amendment to Duties Addressing the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People’s Republic of China (Presidential Actions February 5, 2025)

On February 5, 2025, the U.S. President issued an executive order amending a previous order from February 1, 2025, which imposed duties on products from China to address the synthetic opioid supply chain. The amendment specifically changes how certain goods are treated under the "de minimis" rule, which allows for duty-free treatment of low-value imports. The amendment states that this duty-free treatment will no longer apply once the Secretary of Commerce confirms that systems are in place to efficiently collect tariffs on these goods.

The executive order aims to combat the flow of synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl, from China to the United States. It highlights the role of Chinese chemical companies and transnational criminal organizations in producing and distributing these drugs. The order is part of a broader strategy to address the opioid crisis, which has been declared a national emergency due to its severe impact on American society.

## Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports (Presidential Actions February 5, 2025)

The executive order titled "Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports," signed on February 5, 2025, by President Trump, aims to ensure that women and girls have fair and safe opportunities to compete in sports. The order emphasizes that allowing men to compete in women's sports is unfair and dangerous, and it violates Title IX, which mandates equal opportunities for women in educational institutions receiving federal funds. The order directs the withdrawal of federal funding from educational programs that allow male participation in women's sports, thereby denying women equal athletic opportunities.

The order outlines specific actions to enforce this policy. It instructs the Secretary of Education to ensure compliance with court orders that vacated previous Title IX regulations and to protect female athletic opportunities by clarifying that women's sports are reserved for women. It also mandates federal agencies to review and potentially rescind funding from non-compliant educational programs. Additionally, the Department of Justice is tasked with providing resources to enforce these policies swiftly.

Furthermore, the order addresses broader sports policies by convening representatives from major athletic organizations and state attorneys general to promote fair and safe policies for female athletes. It also involves international efforts to promote sex-based categories in sports competitions. The order does not create any new legal rights but aims to reinforce existing protections for women in sports.

## Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies (Presidential Actions February 6, 2025)

The executive order issued on February 6, 2025, directs the heads of U.S. executive departments and agencies to review all funding provided to nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). The goal is to ensure that future funding aligns with the interests of the United States and the priorities of the current administration. The administration believes that some NGOs have been using taxpayer dollars in ways that undermine the security, prosperity, and safety of the American people. Therefore, the order aims to stop funding NGOs that are perceived to be against national interests.

The memorandum requires agency heads to make funding decisions based on the administration's goals, applicable laws, and their judgment. This directive is part of a broader effort by the administration to reshape the nonprofit sector and its role both domestically and internationally. Organizations that align ideologically with the administration are expected to face fewer challenges, while those that do not may experience increased scrutiny and potential funding cuts. This could significantly impact NGOs involved in international work, humanitarian aid, and policy advocacy, particularly in areas like climate change, immigration, and equity initiatives. These organizations may need to seek alternative funding sources and adjust their focus to align more closely with the administration's interests.

## Eradicating Anti-Christian Bias (Presidential Actions February 6, 2025)

President Donald Trump issued an executive order on February 6, 2025, aimed at eradicating anti-Christian bias in the United States. The order emphasizes the protection of religious freedoms and addresses concerns about the previous administration's alleged targeting of Christians. It claims that the Biden administration engaged in actions that discriminated against Christians, such as prosecuting peaceful pro-life demonstrators and ignoring violence against Christian institutions. In response, Trump pardoned individuals convicted under these circumstances and condemned the lack of action against anti-Christian violence.

To address these issues, the executive order establishes a Task Force to Eradicate Anti-Christian Bias within the Department of Justice. This task force, chaired by the Attorney General, includes members from various government departments and agencies. Its responsibilities include reviewing past government actions for anti-Christian bias, recommending policy changes, and ensuring the protection of religious liberties. The task force is also tasked with identifying deficiencies in existing laws and suggesting improvements to prevent anti-Christian conduct.

The executive order underscores the administration's commitment to protecting religious freedom and ensuring that Christians can practice their faith without fear of discrimination or retaliation. It aims to rectify past injustices and prevent future anti-Christian bias by enforcing existing laws and potentially recommending new legislative actions. The task force will operate for two years, during which it will report its findings and recommendations to the President.

## Imposing Sanctions on the International Criminal Court (Presidential Actions February 6, 2025)

On February 6, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump issued an executive order imposing sanctions on the International Criminal Court (ICC). The order accuses the ICC of engaging in "illegitimate and baseless actions" against the United States and its ally, Israel. The ICC had issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, accusing them of war crimes during the conflict with Hamas in Gaza. The U.S. and Israel are not members of the ICC, and Trump argues that the court's actions threaten U.S. national security and undermine its sovereignty.

The executive order authorizes economic and travel sanctions against ICC officials involved in investigations against U.S. citizens or allies. This includes freezing assets and blocking entry into the U.S. for those individuals and their families. Trump emphasizes that the U.S. opposes any ICC actions against non-member countries like the U.S. and Israel, and expects its allies to do the same. The order also declares a national emergency to address the perceived threat posed by the ICC's actions.

The sanctions have sparked criticism from international bodies and human rights organizations, who argue that they undermine global accountability for serious crimes. The ICC, which prosecutes individuals for war crimes and crimes against humanity, has vowed to continue its work despite the sanctions. Critics, including Human Rights Watch, warn that the sanctions could hinder the ICC's ability to deliver justice and protect victims of atrocities worldwide.

## President Trump Announces Appointments to the White House Faith Office (Presidential Actions February 7, 2025)

President Donald Trump has announced the establishment of the White House Faith Office, which aims to empower faith-based entities, community organizations, and houses of worship to better serve families and communities. This office will be part of the Domestic Policy Council and will work to ensure that these organizations can compete fairly for federal grants and funding opportunities. The office will also focus on protecting religious liberty and ending religious discrimination by the federal government.

Pastor Paula White-Cain has been appointed as a Senior Advisor to the White House Faith Office. She has a long history of advocating for religious freedom and humanitarian rights and has previously served as an advisor to President Trump. Jennifer S. Korn will serve as the Deputy Assistant to the President and Faith Director, bringing her experience in engaging with various communities during Trump's previous term. Jackson Lane will join as Special Assistant to the President and Deputy Director of Faith Engagement.

The executive order establishing this office also includes a task force to address anti-Christian bias and discrimination within the federal government. This task force, led by Attorney General Pam Bondi, will work to identify and halt any anti-Christian targeting and ensure the protection of religious liberties. The White House Faith Office will consult with faith leaders on policy changes and collaborate with other agencies to support faith-based organizations in obtaining government grants and implementing religious liberty protections.

## Establishment of The White House Faith Office (Presidential Actions February 7, 2025)

On February 7, 2025, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to establish the White House Faith Office. This office is designed to empower faith-based entities, community organizations, and houses of worship to better serve American families and communities. The office will be part of the Domestic Policy Council and will work closely with various government agencies to ensure that these organizations can compete fairly for federal grants and funding opportunities. The executive order emphasizes the importance of religious liberty and aims to eliminate any form of religious discrimination by the federal government.

The White House Faith Office will have several key responsibilities. It will consult with faith and community leaders to gather expertise on various issues, such as protecting women and children, strengthening families, and promoting religious liberty. The office will also make policy recommendations to the President and advise on the implementation of policies that enable faith-based organizations to serve communities more effectively. Additionally, it will coordinate with agencies to provide training and education on religious liberty and help faith-based organizations access government grants.

The executive order also amends previous orders related to faith-based initiatives, renaming the existing White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives to the White House Faith Office. Each federal agency is required to appoint a Faith Liaison to oversee efforts to support the office's mission.

## Protecting Second Amendment Rights (Presidential Actions February 7, 2025)

The executive order titled "Protecting Second Amendment Rights," issued on February 7, 2025, by President Trump, emphasizes the importance of the Second Amendment as a fundamental safeguard of security and liberty in the United States. The order asserts that the right to keep and bear arms is essential for protecting all other rights and should not be infringed. It directs the Attorney General to review all executive actions from January 2021 to January 2025 that might have affected Second Amendment rights and to propose a plan to protect these rights.

The Attorney General is tasked with examining various aspects, including rules from the Department of Justice and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, as well as actions related to firearms regulations and litigation positions that could impact Second Amendment rights. The review aims to identify any ongoing infringements and suggest measures to safeguard these rights. The Attorney General must present a proposed plan of action to the President within 30 days, which will then be finalized and implemented in collaboration with the Domestic Policy Advisor.

This executive order is seen as a move to potentially roll back gun control measures implemented during the Biden administration, including regulations on ghost guns and expanded background checks. It has been praised by gun rights advocates for prioritizing Second Amendment protections but criticized by gun control groups for potentially undermining public safety efforts. The order signals a shift in federal firearms policy, with a focus on enhancing gun rights and reassessing previous regulations.

## Addressing Egregious Actions of The Republic of South Africa (Presidential Actions February 7, 2025)

On February 7, 2025, the U.S. President issued an executive order in response to actions taken by the Republic of South Africa. The order criticizes South Africa's Expropriation Act 13 of 2024, which allows the government to seize land from ethnic minority Afrikaners without compensation. The U.S. views this as a violation of human rights and a continuation of policies that dismantle equal opportunities and fuel violence against certain racial groups. Additionally, South Africa's foreign policy actions, such as its stance against Israel and its relations with Iran, are seen as threats to U.S. national security and foreign policy interests.

The executive order outlines the U.S. policy to halt all aid and assistance to South Africa as long as these practices continue. It also emphasizes support for Afrikaner refugees facing racial discrimination, including property confiscation. U.S. agencies are directed to stop foreign aid to South Africa, with exceptions only if deemed necessary by agency heads. The order also prioritizes the resettlement of Afrikaner refugees in the U.S. through the Refugee Admissions Program.

The order is part of a broader shift in U.S.-South Africa relations, reflecting concerns over South Africa's domestic policies and international alignments. It underscores the U.S. commitment to addressing human rights violations and protecting its national interests, while also highlighting the complexities of South Africa's efforts to address historical land ownership disparities rooted in its apartheid past.

## Gulf of America Day, 2025 (Presidential Actions February 9, 2025)

On February 9, 2025, President Donald Trump proclaimed the day as the first Gulf of America Day. This proclamation follows an executive order he signed on January 20, 2025, which renamed the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. The renaming was part of a broader initiative to restore names that honor American greatness. The area now called the Gulf of America is bordered by the U.S. states of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida, extending to the boundaries with Mexico and Cuba.

The renaming was justified by the President as a way to acknowledge the Gulf's historical significance to the United States. Trump emphasized that the Gulf has been a crucial asset to the nation and remains an integral part of America's identity. The proclamation of Gulf of America Day is intended to foster national pride and encourage Americans to celebrate this change with various programs and activities.

President Trump called upon public officials and citizens to observe Gulf of America Day with appropriate ceremonies and activities. This move is part of his administration's efforts to promote American pride and commemorate historical changes that reflect the nation's values and heritage.

## Ending Procurement and Forced Use of Paper Straws (Presidential Actions February 10, 2025)

On February 10, 2025, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to stop the federal government from buying and using paper straws. The order argues that paper straws are less effective, more expensive, and potentially harmful to health due to the chemicals used in their production. It also points out that paper straws often come wrapped in plastic, which contradicts the environmental benefits they are supposed to offer. The order aims to reverse previous policies that discouraged the use of plastic straws, which Trump had revoked earlier in January 2025.

The executive order directs federal agencies to stop purchasing paper straws and to remove any policies that disfavor plastic straws. Within 45 days, a national strategy is to be developed to end the use of paper straws, addressing policies that ban or penalize plastic straws and exploring other methods to implement this policy nationwide. This move is part of a broader effort to promote the use of plastic straws over paper ones, citing concerns over the functionality and environmental impact of paper straws.

The order also includes general provisions to ensure it does not interfere with existing legal authorities or budgetary processes. This decision has sparked debate, with environmental groups criticizing the move for potentially increasing plastic waste, while the plastics industry has welcomed it as a practical solution.

## Eliminating the Federal Executive Institute (Presidential Actions February 10, 2025)

On February 10, 2025, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to eliminate the Federal Executive Institute (FEI), a government program established over 50 years ago to provide leadership training for federal bureaucrats. The decision is part of a broader effort to reduce government inefficiency and ensure that taxpayer dollars are used effectively. The administration believes that the FEI has contributed to the growth of a bureaucratic class in Washington, D.C., which does not directly benefit American families or align with national interests.

The executive order directs the Office of Personnel Management to take all necessary steps to close the FEI and revokes previous documents that established or required its existence. This move is consistent with the administration's policy to eliminate government programs that do not provide measurable benefits to the American people. The order emphasizes that the government should focus on serving taxpayers and upholding the Constitution rather than maintaining a large federal bureaucracy.

While the closure of the FEI is intended to cut wasteful spending, some critics argue that leadership training is essential for effective government operations. The FEI has been a valuable resource for developing leadership skills among federal employees, and its elimination raises questions about how the government will continue to train and develop its workforce. The administration has not yet provided a detailed plan for how it will address these concerns or what alternative training programs might be implemented.

## Pausing Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Enforcement to Further American Economic and National Security (Presidential Actions February 10, 2025)

On February 10, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order to pause the enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) for 180 days. The order argues that the FCPA has been overextended and misused, negatively impacting U.S. interests and foreign policy objectives. The President believes that the current enforcement of the FCPA hinders American companies' global competitiveness and, consequently, national security. The order aims to reduce barriers to American commerce abroad by reviewing and potentially revising the guidelines for FCPA enforcement.

During this 180-day period, the Attorney General is instructed to stop initiating new FCPA investigations unless an exception is warranted. The Attorney General will also review existing investigations to ensure they align with the President's foreign policy goals and issue updated guidelines to promote American economic interests. The review period can be extended for another 180 days if necessary. After the new guidelines are issued, any ongoing or new FCPA actions must be specifically authorized by the Attorney General.

The executive order emphasizes the need to prioritize American economic competitiveness and efficient use of federal resources. It reflects a shift in focus towards protecting U.S. companies from what is perceived as excessive and unpredictable enforcement of the FCPA. However, it is important to note that bribery remains illegal, and companies should continue to maintain compliance programs to adhere to anti-corruption laws both domestically and internationally.

## Adjusting Imports of Steel into The United States (Presidential Actions February 10, 2025)

The executive order issued on February 10, 2025, by President Trump focuses on adjusting the imports of steel into the United States to protect national security. Initially, in 2018, a 25% tariff was imposed on steel imports from most countries to address the threat posed by excessive steel imports to U.S. national security. Over time, some countries were exempted or given alternative arrangements, but these have not been effective in reducing the threat. As a result, the order terminates these exemptions and arrangements, reinstating the 25% tariff on steel imports from countries like Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, the EU, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, the UK, and Ukraine, effective March 12, 2025.

The order also highlights the failure of alternative agreements with certain countries to adequately address the issues of excess steel capacity and unfair trading practices, particularly those involving China. The increased imports from exempted countries have negatively impacted the U.S. steel industry, leading to depressed performance and capacity utilization rates below the desired 80%. The proclamation aims to ensure that the domestic steel industry can sustain its production capacity and protect national security by reapplying the tariffs universally.

Additionally, the order addresses the issue of derivative steel products, which have been used to circumvent the tariffs. It expands the scope of the tariffs to include more derivative steel articles and terminates the product exclusion process that allowed certain imports to bypass the tariffs. This comprehensive approach is intended to strengthen the U.S. steel industry and prevent further impairment of national security by ensuring that all steel imports are subject to the same tariff conditions.

## Implementing The President’s “Department of Government Efficiency” Workforce Optimization Initiative (Presidential Actions February 11, 2025)

The executive order titled "Implementing The President’s 'Department of Government Efficiency' Workforce Optimization Initiative" aims to transform the federal bureaucracy by reducing waste and inefficiency. The order introduces measures to shrink the federal workforce, requiring agencies to hire no more than one new employee for every four that leave, except in areas related to public safety, immigration enforcement, or law enforcement. This initiative is part of a broader effort to make the government more accountable and efficient, ultimately benefiting American families, workers, and taxpayers.

To achieve these goals, the order mandates agency heads to develop data-driven hiring plans in consultation with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) Team Leads. These plans should focus on filling positions in high-need areas and require approval from DOGE Team Leads before hiring decisions are made. Additionally, the order calls for large-scale reductions in force (RIFs), prioritizing non-essential functions and diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is tasked with revising federal hiring suitability criteria to ensure high standards of conduct among federal employees.

The order also includes provisions for agency reorganization, requiring agency heads to report on statutory requirements and consider eliminating or consolidating subcomponents. Exemptions are allowed for positions necessary for national security, homeland security, or public safety. Overall, this executive order seeks to streamline the federal workforce and improve government efficiency through strategic hiring and organizational restructuring.

## President Trump Announces the President’s Intelligence Advisory Board (Presidential Actions February 11, 2025)

President Donald J. Trump announced the formation of the President’s Intelligence Advisory Board (PIAB) on February 11, 2025. This board is composed of a group of individuals who are considered distinguished and trusted patriots. Their main role is to advise the President on critical national security challenges and ensure that the Intelligence Community aligns with the President's "America First" agenda. The board members are selected for their diverse experience and intellect, which are expected to help restore integrity within the Intelligence Community.

The appointed members of the PIAB include Devin Gerald Nunes as the Chair, along with Scott Glabe, Amaryllis Fox Kennedy, Brad Robert Wenstrup, Wayne Berman, Reince Priebus, Robert O’Brien, Joshua Lobel, Sander R. Gerber, Katie Miller, Jeremy Katz, and Thomas Ollis Hicks, Jr. These individuals bring a wide range of expertise and perspectives to the board, which is intended to enhance the effectiveness and accountability of the Intelligence Community in addressing the nation's security issues.

## Adjusting Imports of Aluminum into The United States (Presidential Actions February 11, 2025)

In this executive order, the U.S. President addresses the issue of aluminum imports, which are seen as a threat to national security. Initially, a 10% tariff was imposed on aluminum imports in 2018 to protect domestic industries. However, this measure has not been effective enough due to global excess capacity, particularly from China, and loopholes that allowed some countries to avoid these tariffs. As a result, domestic aluminum production has suffered, with decreased production and facility closures.

To counter these issues, the President has decided to increase the tariff on aluminum imports from 10% to 25%. This increase aims to better protect the U.S. aluminum industry by making foreign aluminum more expensive and less competitive in the U.S. market. Additionally, the order terminates previous agreements with countries like Argentina, Australia, Canada, Mexico, the EU, and the UK, which had allowed them to avoid these tariffs. These countries will now be subject to the same 25% tariff as other nations.

The executive order also addresses the problem of derivative aluminum products, which have been used to circumvent tariffs. It expands the tariffs to include these products and ends the process that allowed for product exclusions. This comprehensive approach is intended to close loopholes and ensure that the tariffs effectively support the U.S. aluminum industry, aiming for a production capacity utilization of at least 80%, which is considered necessary for national security.

## One Voice for America’s Foreign Relations (Presidential Actions February 12, 2025)

The executive order titled "One Voice for America’s Foreign Relations" emphasizes the President's authority over U.S. foreign policy, as granted by Article II of the Constitution. It mandates that all government officials involved in foreign policy must act under the President's direction. The Secretary of State is tasked with ensuring that the workforce implementing foreign policy is effective and loyal to the President's agenda. Failure to comply with these directives can lead to disciplinary actions, including termination.

The order outlines specific definitions for terms related to the Foreign Service and Civil Service employees, ensuring clarity in its application. It also grants the Secretary of State the discretion to take necessary personnel actions when employees fail to meet performance standards. The Secretary is responsible for reforming the Foreign Service to align with the President's foreign policy goals, including revising recruitment, evaluation, and training processes.

Finally, the order clarifies that it does not override existing legal authorities or create new legal rights. It must be implemented in accordance with applicable laws and budgetary constraints. This ensures that the order respects the legal framework and does not infringe on the powers of other branches of government or existing laws.
