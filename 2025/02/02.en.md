## China Increasing Production of Self-Driving Cars

China is set to see a significant increase in electric vehicles (EVs) equipped with self-driving
features this year, with about 15 million new cars expected to have at least Level 2 (L2) autonomous
driving capabilities. This development is largely attributed to the declining cost of lidar
technology, which is essential for enabling self-driving features. The cost of lidar sensors has
dropped significantly, from thousands of dollars to around $200 per unit, making it more feasible
for manufacturers to include these features even in lower-priced models.

These L2 capabilities allow vehicles to control steering, acceleration, and deceleration, although
drivers must remain ready to take control at any time. The adoption of these technologies marks a
pivotal moment in the global automobile industry, as Chinese manufacturers aim to democratize
high-end autonomous driving systems across a broader range of vehicles.

Chinese carmakers are intensifying their efforts to compete with Tesla, which is considered a leader
in self-driving technology with its Full Self-Driving (FSD) system. Although Tesla's FSD is not yet
approved for use in China, it is expected to enter testing soon. The competitive landscape is
driving Chinese manufacturers to innovate and offer advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) at
more affordable prices, with some models priced below 100,000 yuan (approximately US$13,914).

This surge in self-driving EVs is expected to reshape the automotive market in China, with two out
of three new cars sold in 2025 projected to have L2 or higher autonomous driving capabilities. The
move towards intelligent vehicles is seen as a new battleground for carmakers, as they strive to
capture the interest of young drivers who are keen on the self-driving experience.

## US Military Conducts Airstrikes in Somalia

The U.S. military conducted airstrikes against Islamic State (ISIS) operatives in Somalia on
February 1, 2025. These strikes were ordered by President Donald Trump and coordinated with the
Somali government. The operation targeted a senior ISIS attack planner and other operatives in the
Golis Mountains, successfully destroying their hideouts and killing multiple terrorists without
harming civilians.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated that the airstrikes were a clear signal of the U.S.'s
commitment to eliminating terrorist threats to the U.S. and its allies. The operation aimed to
degrade ISIS's ability to plan and execute attacks. The U.S. Africa Command, responsible for the
operation, emphasized its efforts to prevent civilian harm and will continue to assess the
operation's results.

President Trump criticized former President Joe Biden for not acting swiftly enough against the
targeted ISIS operatives, although Biden's administration had conducted other airstrikes in Somalia
targeting terrorist groups. The Somali government expressed its commitment to working with allies to
combat extremist threats and ensure regional stability.

## Mexico and Canada Order Retaliatory Tariffs

In response to U.S. President Donald Trump's imposition of tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada,
and China, both Mexico and Canada have announced retaliatory measures.

### Canada's Response

- Canada announced retaliatory tariffs in response to the U.S. tariffs of 25% on Canadian goods.
- The Canadian government will impose two tranches of 25% tariffs on U.S. exports to Canada. The
  first tranche will take effect on February 4, 2025, and the second tranche will follow after a
  21-day comment period.
- The second tranche is expected to be broader, covering products such as vehicles, steel, aluminum,
  and various agricultural products.
- Combined, these tariffs will affect approximately C$155 billion worth of U.S. exports, accounting
  for about one-third of annual U.S. exports to Canada.

### Mexico's Response

- Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum ordered retaliatory tariffs against the U.S. following the
  imposition of 25% tariffs on Mexican imports.
- The Mexican government rejected the U.S. accusations of alliances with criminal organizations and
  emphasized its stance against U.S. interference in Mexican affairs.
- Mexico's response includes implementing retaliatory tariffs and other measures to protect its
  interests.

### Context and Implications

- The U.S. tariffs were justified by President Trump as necessary to protect American interests,
  including addressing issues related to fentanyl and illegal immigration.
- The tariffs have sparked a trade war among North American allies, with potential negative impacts
  on economic growth and inflation.
- Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expressed disappointment and highlighted the historical
  cooperation between Canada and the U.S., urging Canadians to choose domestic products over
  American ones.

These developments indicate a significant escalation in trade tensions between the U.S. and its
North American neighbors, with potential widespread economic consequences.

## USAID Security Officials On Leave After Conflict with DOGE

The recent removal of USAID security leaders has sparked significant controversy and discussion. The
incident occurred when security leaders at the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)
were placed on administrative leave after refusing to grant access to employees from Elon Musk's
Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to secure systems. These systems included personnel files
and classified information, which the DOGE employees did not have the appropriate security clearance
to access.

The situation escalated when DOGE employees threatened to involve U.S. Marshals to gain access.
Eventually, they were able to access the systems, although it remains unclear what specific
information was obtained. Elon Musk publicly criticized USAID, labeling it a "criminal organization"
and calling for its dissolution.

This incident is part of broader discussions and actions under the Trump administration regarding
USAID. There have been efforts to place USAID under the authority of the State Department, a move
that has faced criticism from Democrats and legal experts who argue it would violate the law
establishing USAID as an independent agency. Additionally, the Trump administration has implemented
a freeze on U.S. global assistance, leading to significant staff reductions and operational
disruptions within USAID.

The situation has raised concerns about the legality and implications of these actions, with some
lawmakers and organizations warning of the potential negative impact on global humanitarian efforts
and U.S. foreign relations. The controversy continues to unfold, with potential legal challenges and
further political ramifications expected.

## China Is Building World's Largest Military Command Center

China is constructing the world's largest military command center near Beijing, known as the
