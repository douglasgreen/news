## Imposing Duties to Address the Situation at Our Southern Border (Presidential Actions, February 1, 2025)

On February 1, 2025, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to impose additional tariffs on products from Mexico. This decision was made in response to a declared national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border, which was attributed to the influx of illegal immigrants and drugs, particularly opioids, into the United States. The executive order cites the failure of Mexico to effectively combat drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) and other criminal activities as a significant threat to U.S. national security, foreign policy, and economy.

The order mandates a 25% tariff on all Mexican products entering the United States, effective February 4, 2025. However, goods already in transit before this date are exempt from the additional duty. The tariffs are intended to pressure Mexico into taking more decisive action against drug trafficking and illegal migration. The order also allows for the possibility of increasing tariffs if Mexico retaliates with its own trade measures against the U.S. The Secretary of Homeland Security, along with other key officials, is tasked with monitoring the situation and advising the President on Mexico's compliance and cooperation.

The executive order emphasizes the urgency of addressing the crisis at the southern border and the need for immediate action. It underscores the President's commitment to protecting U.S. sovereignty and security by enforcing stricter border controls and trade measures. The order also outlines the legal framework and authority under which these actions are being taken, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and the National Emergencies Act (NEA).

## Imposing Duties to Address the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People’s Republic of China (Presidential Actions, February 1, 2025)

On February 1, 2025, President Donald J. Trump issued an executive order to impose additional tariffs on products from the People's Republic of China (PRC) in response to the ongoing synthetic opioid crisis in the United States. The order highlights the severe impact of synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl, which are largely sourced from China and have led to significant loss of life and societal harm in the U.S. The Chinese government and its enterprises are accused of facilitating the export of these harmful substances and supporting criminal organizations involved in their distribution.

The executive order declares a national emergency due to the influx of synthetic opioids and the failure of the PRC to take adequate measures to curb the flow of these drugs. As a result, a 10% ad valorem tariff is imposed on all Chinese products entering the U.S., effective February 4, 2025. This action aims to pressure China into cooperating more effectively to address the opioid crisis. The order also outlines the conditions under which these tariffs might be adjusted or removed, depending on China's response and cooperation in mitigating the crisis.

The order empowers the Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with other key officials, to implement and enforce these tariffs. It also mandates regular consultations and reports to assess the situation and determine if further actions are necessary. The executive order underscores the U.S. government's commitment to protecting its citizens from the dangers posed by synthetic opioids and holding the PRC accountable for its role in the crisis.

The order highlights the severe impact of these drugs on American society, including public health crises and strain on healthcare systems. It criticizes Canada for not doing enough to curb the production and distribution of these drugs, which are often smuggled into the U.S. by drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) and transnational cartels. In response, the order imposes additional tariffs on Canadian products to pressure Canada into taking more effective action against drug trafficking.

The executive order declares a national emergency under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and the National Emergencies Act (NEA), expanding the scope of a previous emergency declaration related to the southern border. It imposes a 25% tariff on most Canadian goods and a 10% tariff on Canadian energy resources. These tariffs are intended to remain until Canada takes sufficient steps to address the drug crisis. The order also outlines procedures for implementing these tariffs and specifies that no duty-free treatment will be available for the affected goods.

The order authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with other key officials, to take necessary actions to implement the tariffs and monitor the situation. It also allows for the possibility of increasing tariffs if Canada retaliates. The order emphasizes the need for immediate and decisive action to protect American citizens and maintain national security, urging Canada to cooperate in resolving the drug trafficking issue.

## American Heart Month, 2025 (Presidential Actions, February 3, 2025)

Overall, the message is one of hope and action, urging Americans to take care of their health and work together to combat heart disease. The proclamation serves as a reminder of the importance of heart health and the collective effort needed to address this critical issue.

## Career and Technical Education Month, 2025 (Presidential Actions, February 3, 2025)

In February 2025, President Trump declared it Career and Technical Education Month to emphasize the importance of vocational training in the United States. He highlighted that hardworking Americans are crucial to the nation's success and that his administration is committed to providing students and workers with the necessary skills to thrive in a rapidly changing technological landscape. By investing in career and technical education, the administration aims to strengthen the workforce and boost the economy, ensuring that Americans have the skills needed for high-demand careers, particularly in fields like science, technology, and engineering.

President Trump mentioned the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act, which he signed during his first term. This act has provided millions of students with valuable vocational opportunities, contributing to significant economic growth and development. The administration's goal is to make technology work for Americans, not the other way around, by equipping people with real skills for real careers that are essential for community development.

Looking forward, the administration plans to continue investing in the next generation by expanding access to high-quality career and technical education. This initiative aims to rebuild the economy, raise wages, and strengthen families, ultimately positioning America as a leader in innovation and entrepreneurship.

## Progress on the Situation at Our Southern Border (Presidential Actions, February 3, 2025)

The executive order issued on February 3, 2025, addresses the situation at the U.S. southern border, focusing on the threat posed by Mexican drug trafficking organizations and other illegal activities. The President has determined that these activities constitute a significant threat to U.S. national security, foreign policy, and economy. To counter this, the President initially imposed tariffs on Mexican products but has now paused these tariffs to allow time to assess Mexico's efforts in addressing the crisis. The pause will last until March 4, 2025, during which the situation will be closely monitored by various U.S. government officials.

The order acknowledges that Mexico has taken steps to mitigate illegal migration and drug trafficking, but it remains to be seen if these actions are sufficient. During the pause, the Secretary of Homeland Security, along with other key officials, will evaluate the situation. If the crisis worsens or if Mexico's efforts are deemed inadequate, the President may reinstate the tariffs immediately. The order also includes provisions to ensure that if any part of it is invalidated, the rest remains effective.

Overall, this executive order reflects a strategic approach to managing the border crisis by leveraging economic measures while allowing time for diplomatic and cooperative efforts with Mexico. It highlights the importance of assessing the effectiveness of international cooperation in addressing cross-border issues and maintaining national security.

## A Plan for Establishing a United States Sovereign Wealth Fund (Presidential Actions, February 3, 2025)

On February 3, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order to create a U.S. sovereign wealth fund. The purpose of this fund is to manage the country's wealth for the benefit of American citizens. It aims to ensure long-term financial stability, reduce taxes for families and small businesses, secure economic prosperity for future generations, and enhance the U.S.'s economic and strategic leadership globally. The fund will be developed by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Commerce, who will submit a detailed plan to the President within 90 days. This plan will include strategies for funding, investment, structure, and governance, as well as legal considerations for establishing the fund.

A sovereign wealth fund is a state-owned investment fund that manages a country's financial assets. These funds are typically created from surplus revenues, such as those from natural resources or foreign exchange reserves. They are used to diversify a country's economy and preserve wealth for future generations. The U.S. sovereign wealth fund could potentially be funded by government-owned assets, such as tariffs or other revenues, although the specifics are not yet clear. The fund could invest in various assets, including stocks, bonds, real estate, and infrastructure projects.

The executive order emphasizes that the creation of the sovereign wealth fund should not interfere with existing legal authorities or budgetary functions. The establishment of this fund is seen as a significant step towards enhancing the U.S.'s financial health and international influence, although it faces challenges due to the country's existing budget deficit.

## Progress on the Situation at Our Northern Border (Presidential Actions, February 3, 2025)

The executive order titled "Progress on the Situation at Our Northern Border" addresses concerns about illegal activities, such as drug trafficking and illegal migration, occurring at the U.S.-Canada border. The President has identified these issues as a significant threat to U.S. national security, foreign policy, and the economy. To counter this threat, the President initially decided to impose tariffs on Canadian goods. However, recognizing Canada's recent efforts to tackle these issues, the implementation of these tariffs has been paused until March 4, 2025, to allow time to assess the effectiveness of Canada's actions.

During this pause, U.S. officials, including the Secretary of Homeland Security and other key advisors, will continue to monitor the situation at the northern border. If the situation worsens or if Canada fails to take adequate measures, the President may decide to enforce the tariffs immediately.

## National Security Presidential Memorandum/NSPM-2 (Presidential Actions, February 4, 2025)

The National Security Presidential Memorandum/NSPM-2, issued on February 4, 2025, is an executive order aimed at imposing maximum pressure on Iran to prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons and to counter its influence in the region. The order highlights Iran's history of hostility towards the United States and its allies, its support for terrorist organizations, and its human rights abuses. It emphasizes the need to deny Iran any path to nuclear weapons and to stop its support for terrorism and regional aggression.

The memorandum outlines a comprehensive strategy involving multiple U.S. government departments and agencies. Key actions include imposing and enforcing sanctions, driving Iran's oil exports to zero, and isolating Iran diplomatically. The Secretary of the Treasury is tasked with enforcing sanctions and denying Iran access to revenue, while the Secretary of State is to lead efforts to isolate Iran internationally. The Attorney General is directed to take legal actions against Iranian-sponsored networks and assets in the U.S. and abroad.

## Withdrawing the United States from and Ending Funding to Certain United Nations Organizations and Reviewing United States Support to All International Organizations (Presidential Actions, February 4, 2025)

The executive order issued on February 4, 2025, by the U.S. President outlines a significant shift in the United States' involvement with certain United Nations organizations. The order highlights concerns that some UN bodies, such as the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC), the UN Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), have deviated from their original missions and are acting against U.S. interests. As a result, the U.S. will cease participation in the UNHRC and stop funding UNRWA, citing issues such as infiltration by terrorist organizations and anti-Israel sentiment.

The order mandates a review of U.S. membership in UNESCO to assess its alignment with American interests, particularly concerning any anti-Semitic or anti-Israel biases. Additionally, the Secretary of State, in collaboration with the U.S. Ambassador to the UN, is tasked with reviewing all international organizations and treaties the U.S. is involved with to determine if they align with national interests. This review aims to identify organizations that may require reform or from which the U.S. should withdraw.

Furthermore, the executive order instructs that no U.S. funds be used for contributions to UNRWA and the UNHRC. It also requires the Secretary of State to inform relevant UN bodies of the U.S.'s decision to halt funding and participation. This move reflects a broader strategy to reassess and potentially reduce U.S. involvement in international organizations that do not align with its strategic interests.

## Amendment to Duties Addressing the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People’s Republic of China (Presidential Actions, February 5, 2025)

On February 5, 2025, the U.S. President issued an executive order amending a previous order from February 1, 2025, which imposed duties on products from China to address the synthetic opioid supply chain. The amendment specifically changes how certain goods are treated under the "de minimis" rule, which allows for duty-free treatment of low-value imports. The amendment states that this duty-free treatment will no longer apply once the Secretary of Commerce confirms that systems are in place to efficiently collect tariffs on these goods.

The executive order aims to combat the flow of synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl, from China to the United States. It highlights the role of Chinese chemical companies and transnational criminal organizations in producing and distributing these drugs. The order is part of a broader strategy to address the opioid crisis, which has been declared a national emergency due to its severe impact on American society.

## Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports (Presidential Actions, February 5, 2025)

The executive order titled "Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports," signed on February 5, 2025, by President Trump, aims to ensure that women and girls have fair and safe opportunities to compete in sports. The order emphasizes that allowing men to compete in women's sports is unfair and dangerous, and it violates Title IX, which mandates equal opportunities for women in educational institutions receiving federal funds. The order directs the withdrawal of federal funding from educational programs that allow male participation in women's sports, thereby denying women equal athletic opportunities.

The order outlines specific actions to enforce this policy. It instructs the Secretary of Education to ensure compliance with court orders that vacated previous Title IX regulations and to protect female athletic opportunities by clarifying that women's sports are reserved for women. It also mandates federal agencies to review and potentially rescind funding from non-compliant educational programs. Additionally, the Department of Justice is tasked with providing resources to enforce these policies swiftly.

Furthermore, the order addresses broader sports policies by convening representatives from major athletic organizations and state attorneys general to promote fair and safe policies for female athletes. It also involves international efforts to promote sex-based categories in sports competitions. The order does not create any new legal rights but aims to reinforce existing protections for women in sports.

## Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies (Presidential Actions, February 6, 2025)

The executive order issued on February 6, 2025, directs the heads of U.S. executive departments and agencies to review all funding provided to nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). The goal is to ensure that future funding aligns with the interests of the United States and the priorities of the current administration. The administration believes that some NGOs have been using taxpayer dollars in ways that undermine the security, prosperity, and safety of the American people. Therefore, the order aims to stop funding NGOs that are perceived to be against national interests.

The memorandum requires agency heads to make funding decisions based on the administration's goals, applicable laws, and their judgment. This directive is part of a broader effort by the administration to reshape the nonprofit sector and its role both domestically and internationally. Organizations that align ideologically with the administration are expected to face fewer challenges, while those that do not may experience increased scrutiny and potential funding cuts. This could significantly impact NGOs involved in international work, humanitarian aid, and policy advocacy, particularly in areas like climate change, immigration, and equity initiatives. These organizations may need to seek alternative funding sources and adjust their focus to align more closely with the administration's interests.

## Eradicating Anti-Christian Bias (Presidential Actions, February 6, 2025)

President Donald Trump issued an executive order on February 6, 2025, aimed at eradicating anti-Christian bias in the United States. The order emphasizes the protection of religious freedoms and addresses concerns about the previous administration's alleged targeting of Christians. It claims that the Biden administration engaged in actions that discriminated against Christians, such as prosecuting peaceful pro-life demonstrators and ignoring violence against Christian institutions. In response, Trump pardoned individuals convicted under these circumstances and condemned the lack of action against anti-Christian violence.

To address these issues, the executive order establishes a Task Force to Eradicate Anti-Christian Bias within the Department of Justice. This task force, chaired by the Attorney General, includes members from various government departments and agencies. Its responsibilities include reviewing past government actions for anti-Christian bias, recommending policy changes, and ensuring the protection of religious liberties. The task force is also tasked with identifying deficiencies in existing laws and suggesting improvements to prevent anti-Christian conduct.

The executive order underscores the administration's commitment to protecting religious freedom and ensuring that Christians can practice their faith without fear of discrimination or retaliation. It aims to rectify past injustices and prevent future anti-Christian bias by enforcing existing laws and potentially recommending new legislative actions. The task force will operate for two years, during which it will report its findings and recommendations to the President.

## Imposing Sanctions on the International Criminal Court (Presidential Actions, February 6, 2025)

On February 6, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump issued an executive order imposing sanctions on the International Criminal Court (ICC). The order accuses the ICC of engaging in "illegitimate and baseless actions" against the United States and its ally, Israel. The ICC had issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, accusing them of war crimes during the conflict with Hamas in Gaza. The U.S. and Israel are not members of the ICC, and Trump argues that the court's actions threaten U.S. national security and undermine its sovereignty.

The executive order authorizes economic and travel sanctions against ICC officials involved in investigations against U.S. citizens or allies. This includes freezing assets and blocking entry into the U.S. for those individuals and their families. Trump emphasizes that the U.S. opposes any ICC actions against non-member countries like the U.S. and Israel, and expects its allies to do the same. The order also declares a national emergency to address the perceived threat posed by the ICC's actions.

The sanctions have sparked criticism from international bodies and human rights organizations, who argue that they undermine global accountability for serious crimes. The ICC, which prosecutes individuals for war crimes and crimes against humanity, has vowed to continue its work despite the sanctions. Critics, including Human Rights Watch, warn that the sanctions could hinder the ICC's ability to deliver justice and protect victims of atrocities worldwide.

## President Trump Announces Appointments to the White House Faith Office (Presidential Actions, February 7, 2025)

President Donald Trump has announced the establishment of the White House Faith Office, which aims to empower faith-based entities, community organizations, and houses of worship to better serve families and communities. This office will be part of the Domestic Policy Council and will work to ensure that these organizations can compete fairly for federal grants and funding opportunities. The office will also focus on protecting religious liberty and ending religious discrimination by the federal government.

Pastor Paula White-Cain has been appointed as a Senior Advisor to the White House Faith Office. She has a long history of advocating for religious freedom and humanitarian rights and has previously served as an advisor to President Trump. Jennifer S. Korn will serve as the Deputy Assistant to the President and Faith Director, bringing her experience in engaging with various communities during Trump's previous term. Jackson Lane will join as Special Assistant to the President and Deputy Director of Faith Engagement.

The executive order establishing this office also includes a task force to address anti-Christian bias and discrimination within the federal government. This task force, led by Attorney General Pam Bondi, will work to identify and halt any anti-Christian targeting and ensure the protection of religious liberties. The White House Faith Office will consult with faith leaders on policy changes and collaborate with other agencies to support faith-based organizations in obtaining government grants and implementing religious liberty protections.

## Establishment of The White House Faith Office (Presidential Actions, February 7, 2025)

On February 7, 2025, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to establish the White House Faith Office. This office is designed to empower faith-based entities, community organizations, and houses of worship to better serve American families and communities. The office will be part of the Domestic Policy Council and will work closely with various government agencies to ensure that these organizations can compete fairly for federal grants and funding opportunities. The executive order emphasizes the importance of religious liberty and aims to eliminate any form of religious discrimination by the federal government.

The White House Faith Office will have several key responsibilities. It will consult with faith and community leaders to gather expertise on various issues, such as protecting women and children, strengthening families, and promoting religious liberty. The office will also make policy recommendations to the President and advise on the implementation of policies that enable faith-based organizations to serve communities more effectively. Additionally, it will coordinate with agencies to provide training and education on religious liberty and help faith-based organizations access government grants.

The executive order also amends previous orders related to faith-based initiatives, renaming the existing White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives to the White House Faith Office. Each federal agency is required to appoint a Faith Liaison to oversee efforts to support the office's mission.

## Protecting Second Amendment Rights (Presidential Actions, February 7, 2025)

The executive order titled "Protecting Second Amendment Rights," issued on February 7, 2025, by President Trump, emphasizes the importance of the Second Amendment as a fundamental safeguard of security and liberty in the United States. The order asserts that the right to keep and bear arms is essential for protecting all other rights and should not be infringed. It directs the Attorney General to review all executive actions from January 2021 to January 2025 that might have affected Second Amendment rights and to propose a plan to protect these rights.

The Attorney General is tasked with examining various aspects, including rules from the Department of Justice and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, as well as actions related to firearms regulations and litigation positions that could impact Second Amendment rights. The review aims to identify any ongoing infringements and suggest measures to safeguard these rights. The Attorney General must present a proposed plan of action to the President within 30 days, which will then be finalized and implemented in collaboration with the Domestic Policy Advisor.

This executive order is seen as a move to potentially roll back gun control measures implemented during the Biden administration, including regulations on ghost guns and expanded background checks. It has been praised by gun rights advocates for prioritizing Second Amendment protections but criticized by gun control groups for potentially undermining public safety efforts. The order signals a shift in federal firearms policy, with a focus on enhancing gun rights and reassessing previous regulations.

## Addressing Egregious Actions of The Republic of South Africa (Presidential Actions, February 7, 2025)

On February 7, 2025, the U.S. President issued an executive order in response to actions taken by the Republic of South Africa. The order criticizes South Africa's Expropriation Act 13 of 2024, which allows the government to seize land from ethnic minority Afrikaners without compensation. The U.S. views this as a violation of human rights and a continuation of policies that dismantle equal opportunities and fuel violence against certain racial groups. Additionally, South Africa's foreign policy actions, such as its stance against Israel and its relations with Iran, are seen as threats to U.S. national security and foreign policy interests.

The executive order outlines the U.S. policy to halt all aid and assistance to South Africa as long as these practices continue. It also emphasizes support for Afrikaner refugees facing racial discrimination, including property confiscation. U.S. agencies are directed to stop foreign aid to South Africa, with exceptions only if deemed necessary by agency heads. The order also prioritizes the resettlement of Afrikaner refugees in the U.S. through the Refugee Admissions Program.

The order is part of a broader shift in U.S.-South Africa relations, reflecting concerns over South Africa's domestic policies and international alignments. It underscores the U.S. commitment to addressing human rights violations and protecting its national interests, while also highlighting the complexities of South Africa's efforts to address historical land ownership disparities rooted in its apartheid past.

## Gulf of America Day, 2025 (Presidential Actions, February 9, 2025)

On February 9, 2025, President Donald Trump proclaimed the day as the first Gulf of America Day. This proclamation follows an executive order he signed on January 20, 2025, which renamed the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. The renaming was part of a broader initiative to restore names that honor American greatness. The area now called the Gulf of America is bordered by the U.S. states of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida, extending to the boundaries with Mexico and Cuba.

The renaming was justified by the President as a way to acknowledge the Gulf's historical significance to the United States. Trump emphasized that the Gulf has been a crucial asset to the nation and remains an integral part of America's identity. The proclamation of Gulf of America Day is intended to foster national pride and encourage Americans to celebrate this change with various programs and activities.

President Trump called upon public officials and citizens to observe Gulf of America Day with appropriate ceremonies and activities. This move is part of his administration's efforts to promote American pride and commemorate historical changes that reflect the nation's values and heritage.

## Ending Procurement and Forced Use of Paper Straws (Presidential Actions, February 10, 2025)

On February 10, 2025, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to stop the federal government from buying and using paper straws. The order argues that paper straws are less effective, more expensive, and potentially harmful to health due to the chemicals used in their production. It also points out that paper straws often come wrapped in plastic, which contradicts the environmental benefits they are supposed to offer. The order aims to reverse previous policies that discouraged the use of plastic straws, which Trump had revoked earlier in January 2025.

The executive order directs federal agencies to stop purchasing paper straws and to remove any policies that disfavor plastic straws. Within 45 days, a national strategy is to be developed to end the use of paper straws, addressing policies that ban or penalize plastic straws and exploring other methods to implement this policy nationwide. This move is part of a broader effort to promote the use of plastic straws over paper ones, citing concerns over the functionality and environmental impact of paper straws.

The order also includes general provisions to ensure it does not interfere with existing legal authorities or budgetary processes. This decision has sparked debate, with environmental groups criticizing the move for potentially increasing plastic waste, while the plastics industry has welcomed it as a practical solution.

## Eliminating the Federal Executive Institute (Presidential Actions, February 10, 2025)

On February 10, 2025, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to eliminate the Federal Executive Institute (FEI), a government program established over 50 years ago to provide leadership training for federal bureaucrats. The decision is part of a broader effort to reduce government inefficiency and ensure that taxpayer dollars are used effectively. The administration believes that the FEI has contributed to the growth of a bureaucratic class in Washington, D.C., which does not directly benefit American families or align with national interests.

The executive order directs the Office of Personnel Management to take all necessary steps to close the FEI and revokes previous documents that established or required its existence. This move is consistent with the administration's policy to eliminate government programs that do not provide measurable benefits to the American people. The order emphasizes that the government should focus on serving taxpayers and upholding the Constitution rather than maintaining a large federal bureaucracy.

While the closure of the FEI is intended to cut wasteful spending, some critics argue that leadership training is essential for effective government operations. The FEI has been a valuable resource for developing leadership skills among federal employees, and its elimination raises questions about how the government will continue to train and develop its workforce. The administration has not yet provided a detailed plan for how it will address these concerns or what alternative training programs might be implemented.

## Pausing Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Enforcement to Further American Economic and National Security (Presidential Actions, February 10, 2025)

On February 10, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order to pause the enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) for 180 days. The order argues that the FCPA has been overextended and misused, negatively impacting U.S. interests and foreign policy objectives. The President believes that the current enforcement of the FCPA hinders American companies' global competitiveness and, consequently, national security. The order aims to reduce barriers to American commerce abroad by reviewing and potentially revising the guidelines for FCPA enforcement.

During this 180-day period, the Attorney General is instructed to stop initiating new FCPA investigations unless an exception is warranted. The Attorney General will also review existing investigations to ensure they align with the President's foreign policy goals and issue updated guidelines to promote American economic interests. The review period can be extended for another 180 days if necessary. After the new guidelines are issued, any ongoing or new FCPA actions must be specifically authorized by the Attorney General.

The executive order emphasizes the need to prioritize American economic competitiveness and efficient use of federal resources. It reflects a shift in focus towards protecting U.S. companies from what is perceived as excessive and unpredictable enforcement of the FCPA. However, it is important to note that bribery remains illegal, and companies should continue to maintain compliance programs to adhere to anti-corruption laws both domestically and internationally.

## Adjusting Imports of Steel into The United States (Presidential Actions, February 10, 2025)

The executive order issued on February 10, 2025, by President Trump focuses on adjusting the imports of steel into the United States to protect national security. Initially, in 2018, a 25% tariff was imposed on steel imports from most countries to address the threat posed by excessive steel imports to U.S. national security. Over time, some countries were exempted or given alternative arrangements, but these have not been effective in reducing the threat. As a result, the order terminates these exemptions and arrangements, reinstating the 25% tariff on steel imports from countries like Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, the EU, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, the UK, and Ukraine, effective March 12, 2025.

The order also highlights the failure of alternative agreements with certain countries to adequately address the issues of excess steel capacity and unfair trading practices, particularly those involving China. The increased imports from exempted countries have negatively impacted the U.S. steel industry, leading to depressed performance and capacity utilization rates below the desired 80%. The proclamation aims to ensure that the domestic steel industry can sustain its production capacity and protect national security by reapplying the tariffs universally.

Additionally, the order addresses the issue of derivative steel products, which have been used to circumvent the tariffs. It expands the scope of the tariffs to include more derivative steel articles and terminates the product exclusion process that allowed certain imports to bypass the tariffs. This comprehensive approach is intended to strengthen the U.S. steel industry and prevent further impairment of national security by ensuring that all steel imports are subject to the same tariff conditions.

## Implementing The President’s “Department of Government Efficiency” Workforce Optimization Initiative (Presidential Actions, February 11, 2025)

The executive order titled "Implementing The President’s 'Department of Government Efficiency' Workforce Optimization Initiative" aims to transform the federal bureaucracy by reducing waste and inefficiency. The order introduces measures to shrink the federal workforce, requiring agencies to hire no more than one new employee for every four that leave, except in areas related to public safety, immigration enforcement, or law enforcement. This initiative is part of a broader effort to make the government more accountable and efficient, ultimately benefiting American families, workers, and taxpayers.

To achieve these goals, the order mandates agency heads to develop data-driven hiring plans in consultation with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) Team Leads. These plans should focus on filling positions in high-need areas and require approval from DOGE Team Leads before hiring decisions are made. Additionally, the order calls for large-scale reductions in force (RIFs), prioritizing non-essential functions and diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is tasked with revising federal hiring suitability criteria to ensure high standards of conduct among federal employees.

The order also includes provisions for agency reorganization, requiring agency heads to report on statutory requirements and consider eliminating or consolidating subcomponents. Exemptions are allowed for positions necessary for national security, homeland security, or public safety. Overall, this executive order seeks to streamline the federal workforce and improve government efficiency through strategic hiring and organizational restructuring.

## Adjusting Imports of Aluminum into The United States (Presidential Actions, February 11, 2025)

In this executive order, the U.S. President addresses the issue of aluminum imports, which are seen as a threat to national security. Initially, a 10% tariff was imposed on aluminum imports in 2018 to protect domestic industries. However, this measure has not been effective enough due to global excess capacity, particularly from China, and loopholes that allowed some countries to avoid these tariffs. As a result, domestic aluminum production has suffered, with decreased production and facility closures.

To counter these issues, the President has decided to increase the tariff on aluminum imports from 10% to 25%. This increase aims to better protect the U.S. aluminum industry by making foreign aluminum more expensive and less competitive in the U.S. market. Additionally, the order terminates previous agreements with countries like Argentina, Australia, Canada, Mexico, the EU, and the UK, which had allowed them to avoid these tariffs. These countries will now be subject to the same 25% tariff as other nations.

The executive order also addresses the problem of derivative aluminum products, which have been used to circumvent tariffs. It expands the tariffs to include these products and ends the process that allowed for product exclusions. This comprehensive approach is intended to close loopholes and ensure that the tariffs effectively support the U.S. aluminum industry, aiming for a production capacity utilization of at least 80%, which is considered necessary for national security.

It also grants the Secretary of State the discretion to take necessary personnel actions when employees fail to meet performance standards. The Secretary is responsible for reforming the Foreign Service to align with the President's foreign policy goals, including revising recruitment, evaluation, and training processes.

Finally, the order clarifies that it does not override existing legal authorities or create new legal rights. It must be implemented in accordance with applicable laws and budgetary constraints. This ensures that the order respects the legal framework and does not infringe on the powers of other branches of government or existing laws.

## Establishing the President’s Make America Healthy Again Commission (Presidential Actions, February 13, 2025)

President Trump has signed an executive order to establish the "Make America Healthy Again Commission" to address the growing health crisis in the United States.

The commission will prioritize research on why Americans are getting sick, work with farmers to ensure healthy food, and expand treatment options to promote healthy lifestyles.

The commission will initially focus on childhood chronic diseases, which have been rising alarmingly. It will study the causes of these diseases, such as diet, environmental factors, and medication overuse, and provide recommendations to the President. The commission will also assess current health programs and data to improve transparency and effectiveness. Within 100 days, it will submit an assessment of childhood chronic diseases, and within 180 days, a strategy to address these issues.

The memorandum directs executive departments and agencies to publicly disclose details of any terminated programs, canceled contracts, or discontinued grants, ensuring that this information is shared to the fullest extent allowed by law. This move is part of a broader effort to allow the American public to see how their tax dollars are being spent and to hold the government accountable for financial decisions.

President Trump has emphasized the need to stop wasteful spending and has taken steps to fulfill his campaign promise of increasing government accountability.

## Expanding Access to In Vitro Fertilization (Presidential Actions, February 18, 2025)

President Donald Trump signed an executive order on February 18, 2025, aimed at expanding access to in vitro fertilization (IVF) for Americans. The order acknowledges the challenges faced by many couples who struggle with infertility, noting that as many as one in seven couples are unable to conceive. The high cost of IVF, which can range from $12,000 to $25,000 per cycle, is a significant barrier for many families.

The order has sparked discussions about the role of government and insurance companies in covering IVF costs, as well as debates about the ethical implications of IVF, particularly among anti-abortion activists who oppose the creation and potential discarding of embryos.

## Ensuring Accountability for All Agencies (Presidential Actions, February 18, 2025)

The executive order issued on February 18, 2025, aims to ensure that all federal agencies, including independent regulatory agencies, are accountable to the President and, through him, to the American people. The order emphasizes that while the President holds all executive power, it is impractical for him to manage all federal operations alone. Therefore, subordinate officers assist in these duties but remain under the President's supervision. The order addresses concerns that previous administrations allowed independent agencies to operate with minimal oversight, leading to a lack of accountability and coherence in executing federal laws.

To address these issues, the order mandates that all executive departments and agencies, including independent ones, submit significant regulatory actions for review by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) before they are published.

## Defending American Companies and Innovators From Overseas Extortion and Unfair Fines and Penalties (Presidential Actions, February 21, 2025)

The memorandum from the President addresses the issue of foreign governments imposing unfair taxes and regulations on American companies, particularly in the technology sector. These actions, such as digital services taxes (DSTs), are seen as attempts by foreign countries to extract revenue from successful American companies, which could cost billions of dollars. The memorandum highlights that these measures not only violate American sovereignty but also increase operational costs and expose sensitive information to potentially hostile foreign regulators. The administration is committed to protecting American companies and workers from these anti-competitive practices and will not allow American businesses to support failing foreign economies through such extortive measures.

To counter these challenges, the administration has outlined a policy to impose tariffs and take other necessary actions against foreign governments that impose discriminatory or disproportionate burdens on American companies.

## America First Investment Policy (Presidential Actions, February 21, 2025)

The "America First Investment Policy," signed on February 21, 2025, is a strategic directive aimed at balancing economic growth with national security. It encourages investments from allied countries while imposing restrictions on investments from adversaries, particularly China. The policy seeks to make the United States an attractive destination for investment by simplifying the process for allies, especially in technology and critical sectors, while being cautious about investments from countries that pose security risks.

Additionally, it ensures that U.S. retirement funds and university endowments do not invest in adversary companies, safeguarding American savings.

Critics of the policy express concerns that it might discourage all foreign investments, potentially harming U.S. companies that rely on foreign funding and leading to higher costs for consumers. They also worry about government overreach in business decisions, which could undermine free market principles. However, proponents argue that the policy is necessary to protect national security and prevent technology theft, while also creating jobs by attracting investments from allies. The success of the policy will depend on balancing these objectives and its impact on U.S. economic competitiveness and international relations.

## Addressing the Threat to National Security from Imports of Copper (Presidential Actions, February 25, 2025)

President Trump has issued an Executive Order to investigate the impact of copper imports on national security. This investigation, led by the Secretary of Commerce, will assess whether the reliance on imported copper, including raw, refined, and derivative forms, poses a threat to the United States' national security. The investigation is prompted by concerns over the U.S.'s dependence on foreign copper sources, particularly as a single foreign producer controls a significant portion of global smelting and refining capacity. The goal is to determine if trade remedies, such as tariffs or export controls, are necessary to protect the domestic copper industry and ensure a stable supply chain for critical sectors like defense and technology.

The investigation will consider various factors, including the current and future demand for copper in defense and infrastructure, the ability of domestic production to meet this demand, and the risks associated with concentrated foreign supply chains.

## Making America Healthy Again by Empowering Patients with Clear, Accurate, and Actionable Healthcare Pricing Information (Presidential Actions, February 25, 2025)

In February 2025, President Trump signed an Executive Order to improve healthcare price transparency in the United States. This order builds on previous efforts from his first term, which aimed to make healthcare pricing more transparent by requiring hospitals and health plans to disclose pricing information. The goal was to empower patients with clear and actionable pricing data, allowing them to make informed healthcare decisions and shop for services based on cost and quality. The order mandates that hospitals display pricing for up to 300 services and provide machine-readable files with negotiated rates. Health plans must also disclose their negotiated rates and actual prices paid for prescription drugs. These measures are expected to save consumers, employers, and insurers up to $80 billion by 2025 and help reduce healthcare costs significantly.

However, progress on enforcing these transparency measures stalled after Trump's first term, with many hospitals and health plans failing to comply fully. The new Executive Order directs the Departments of Treasury, Labor, and Health and Human Services to enforce these regulations more strictly. Within 90 days, these departments must ensure that actual prices, not estimates, are disclosed and that pricing information is standardized across hospitals and health plans.

This initiative is designed to ensure transparency and accountability in government spending. Agency heads are required to work with DOGE team leads to review existing contracts and grants, with the goal of reducing federal spending and reallocating resources to promote efficiency. The order also emphasizes the need for agencies to limit non-essential travel and assess real estate holdings for potential disposal.

In addition to financial oversight, the executive order outlines a plan for agencies to review and potentially terminate or modify contracts and grants that do not align with the administration's efficiency goals. This includes prioritizing the review of funds disbursed to educational institutions and foreign entities to identify waste, fraud, and abuse. Agencies are given a 30-day timeframe to complete these reviews and are instructed to issue guidance on signing new contracts or modifying existing ones to align with government efficiency objectives. The order also requires agencies to develop systems to record approvals for federally funded travel, ensuring that such travel is justified and necessary.

The order further directs agencies to evaluate their real estate assets, identifying properties that can be sold to reduce costs. Within 30 days, agency heads must identify termination rights for existing leases and consult with DOGE personnel and the General Services Administration to determine which leases should be ended. A comprehensive plan for the disposition of unneeded government-owned real estate is to be submitted within 60 days. These measures are part of a broader initiative to streamline government operations, reduce waste, and enhance accountability, with the potential for significant workforce reductions as agencies align with the new directives.
