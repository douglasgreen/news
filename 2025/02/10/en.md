## Trump Orders Halt on Penny Production to Cut Costs

In a surprising move, President Donald Trump has directed the U.S. Treasury to stop minting new pennies. This decision comes as a response to the rising costs associated with producing the one-cent coin. According to reports, each penny costs more than two cents to make, leading to a significant financial loss for the U.S. Mint. In the 2024 fiscal year alone, the Mint lost $85.3 million on the nearly 3.2 billion pennies it produced. Trump announced this decision on his Truth Social platform, emphasizing the wastefulness of continuing to produce a coin that costs more than its face value.

The decision to halt penny production is part of a broader effort by Trump's administration to reduce government spending. Elon Musk, who has been appointed to lead the Department of Government Efficiency, has been tasked with identifying areas where costs can be cut. The penny, with its high production cost and low value, became an obvious target. While Trump did not mention this plan during his campaign, Musk's department highlighted the issue in a recent post, sparking discussions about the coin's future. However, it remains unclear if Trump has the authority to stop penny production without congressional approval, as currency specifications are typically dictated by Congress.

The move to eliminate the penny has been met with mixed reactions. Supporters argue that discontinuing the penny could lead to cost savings and faster transactions at cash registers. They also point out that other countries, like Canada, have successfully eliminated their one-cent coins. On the other hand, some critics worry about the potential impact on pricing and transactions, as prices might need to be rounded to the nearest five cents. Despite these concerns, Trump's administration is determined to push forward with its cost-cutting measures, aiming to save up to $2 trillion by targeting inefficiencies across various government sectors.

## Tom Robbins: A Life of Whimsy and Wisdom

Tom Robbins, the beloved author known for his imaginative and whimsical novels, passed away at the age of 92. Born in Blowing Rock, North Carolina, Robbins grew up in a family he humorously described as a "Southern Baptist version of The Simpsons." From a young age, he showed a knack for storytelling, often dictating stories to his mother. His journey as a writer took him from the South to the Pacific Northwest, where he found a more progressive atmosphere and honed his unique literary voice.

Robbins' novels, such as "Even Cowgirls Get the Blues" and "Jitterbug Perfume," captivated readers with their fantastical characters and playful language. His works often blended humor, philosophy, and spirituality, creating a style that was both entertaining and thought-provoking. Despite being labeled as a counterculture writer, Robbins' themes of feminism, social justice, and environmentalism resonated with a wide audience. His ability to craft sentences that sparkled with wit and wisdom made him a favorite among readers who appreciated his "serious playfulness".

Throughout his life, Robbins remained a vibrant and adventurous spirit. He lived in La Conner, Washington, for over five decades, where he continued to write and inspire others with his "joy in spite of everything" philosophy. His wife, Alexa, described him as "brave, funny, and sweet," and encouraged fans to remember him by reading his books. As Robbins once said, "If you open one of his novels, you'll still find him there, laughing, dancing, and sharing his crazy wisdom with you".

## Omega-3 Supplements: A Key to Slowing Down Aging

In a recent study, researchers have discovered that taking omega-3 supplements daily can help slow down the aging process. The study, published in Nature Aging, focused on older adults and found that omega-3 supplements, especially when combined with vitamin D and regular exercise, can reduce biological aging by several months. This finding is significant because it suggests a simple and accessible way for older adults to maintain their health and vitality as they age.

The study involved over 700 participants aged 70 and above, who were part of the DO-HEALTH trial conducted across five European countries. Participants were divided into groups, with some receiving omega-3 supplements, others vitamin D, and some both, along with a light exercise routine. Blood samples were analyzed using biological clocks that measure aging at a molecular level. The results showed that those who took omega-3 supplements experienced a noticeable slowing in their biological aging, particularly when combined with vitamin D and exercise.

These findings have been met with cautious optimism by experts in the field of aging. While the improvements in biological aging were relatively small, they add to the growing body of evidence supporting the benefits of omega-3, vitamin D, and exercise for older adults. Researchers emphasize the importance of these interventions as low-cost and effective strategies to enhance health and longevity in the aging population. As the study continues, further research will be needed to explore the long-term effects and potential benefits of these supplements on aging and overall health.

## Trump's Positive Start: A New Chapter in American Politics

In the latest CBS News poll, former President Donald Trump has received a positive approval rating as he begins his new term in office. Many Americans are optimistic about his return, with expectations for a stronger economy and lower prices. Trump's plans for deportation have gained popularity, although some citizens feel there is not enough focus on reducing costs. This sentiment reflects a nation eager for economic improvement and stability.

Despite the optimism, there are concerns among Democrats who feel anxious about Trump's policies and their potential impact on rights and freedoms. The poll indicates that while many Democrats are worried, fewer than half are motivated to actively oppose him. This division highlights the ongoing political tension in the country, as citizens navigate their hopes and fears for the future under Trump's leadership.

The poll also reveals that Americans are more hopeful about 2025 compared to the previous year, with Trump's election playing a significant role in this positive outlook. Republicans, in particular, are feeling more optimistic, seeing Trump's leadership as a chance for change and progress. As the nation moves forward, the focus will be on how Trump's policies unfold and whether they meet the high expectations set by his supporters.

## Elon Musk and DOGE to Tackle Pentagon's Spending Woes

Elon Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur, has been tasked with a significant challenge: analyzing the Pentagon's spending. This comes after the Department of Defense (DOD) failed its seventh consecutive audit. President Donald Trump has appointed Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) team to investigate potential waste and fraud within the Pentagon's massive budget, which exceeds $800 billion annually. The goal is to modernize federal technology and improve governmental efficiency, ensuring taxpayer money is spent wisely.

The Pentagon's audit failures have raised concerns about its financial management. Since 2018, the DOD has received a "disclaimer of opinion" on its audits, indicating that the agency's financial records are too disorganized to assess comprehensively. This situation is more severe than an "adverse opinion," which would suggest fraud or mismanagement. The Pentagon's inability to maintain transparent financial records has led to calls for reform, and Musk's involvement is seen as a step towards addressing these issues.

Musk's team will scrutinize various military programs and capabilities, identifying areas where spending can be reduced without compromising national security. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has expressed support for this initiative, emphasizing the importance of passing a clean audit by the end of Trump's second term. The American public deserves to know how their tax dollars are being used, and Musk's efforts with DOGE aim to bring accountability and transparency to the Pentagon's financial practices.
