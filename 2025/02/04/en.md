## UN Nuclear Watchdog Chief Visits Moscow to Address Ukraine Nuclear Safety Concerns

The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, announced plans to visit Moscow to discuss concerns over nuclear safety in Ukraine. This visit comes amid ongoing Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, which pose significant risks to nuclear safety.

Grossi highlighted the precarious situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe's largest, which is currently under Russian control. The plant has been caught in the crossfire of the conflict, raising fears of a potential nuclear disaster. Although the plant's reactors have been shut down, it still requires power and skilled personnel to maintain critical cooling systems and safety protocols.

The attacks on Ukraine's power grid by Russia aim to disrupt the country's energy supply, affecting not only civilian infrastructure but also the defense manufacturing sector. Damage to electrical substations can lead to reliance on emergency diesel generators at nuclear plants, which Grossi described as the "last line of defense" against nuclear accidents.

Grossi's visit to Moscow is intended to address these safety concerns and seek solutions to prevent a nuclear catastrophe in the region. The IAEA chief emphasized the importance of maintaining power and operational stability at nuclear facilities to ensure safety and prevent potential disasters.

## China Imposes New Export Controls on Strategic Metals, Affecting Global Supply Chains

China has recently imposed stringent export controls on critical minerals, specifically targeting the United States amidst an escalating tech trade war. These restrictions focus on minerals like antimony, gallium, and germanium, which are crucial for both civilian and military technologies. This move is a direct response to the U.S. crackdown on China's semiconductor industry, which included limiting China's access to advanced semiconductor technologies and equipment.

The new export controls are part of a broader strategy by China to assert its dominance in the global supply chain of critical minerals. These minerals are essential for the production of advanced semiconductors and defense technologies. The restrictions are expected to have significant implications for U.S. national security and economic interests, as the U.S. heavily relies on imports of these minerals from China.

China's actions are seen as a retaliatory measure against the U.S.'s recent export restrictions on semiconductor technologies. The U.S. has been tightening its controls to prevent China from acquiring advanced technologies that could enhance its military capabilities. In response, China is leveraging its position as a leading producer of these critical minerals to exert pressure on the U.S..

The impact of these restrictions is likely to be profound, affecting industries reliant on these minerals, such as the semiconductor and electric vehicle sectors. The U.S. may need to seek alternative sources for these minerals, potentially looking to other countries for supply, to mitigate the effects of China's export controls.

## Elon Musk Announces Breakthrough in Neuralink Brain Implant Technology

Elon Musk's Neuralink has announced a significant advancement in its brain implant technology. The company has received approval to initiate a new feasibility study named CONVOY. This study will explore the use of Neuralink's wireless brain-computer interface, known as the N1 implant, to control an assistive robotic arm. This development is part of Neuralink's broader vision to restore both digital and physical freedom to individuals with disabilities, such as quadriplegia, by enabling them to control digital devices and potentially robotic limbs with their thoughts.

The N1 implant is designed to interpret neural activity, allowing users to operate computers or smartphones by merely intending to move. This technology has already been tested on a 29-year-old quadriplegic, Noland Arbaugh, who has successfully used it to play chess and video games without physical input. Neuralink's ongoing PRIME study, which involves the precise robotic implantation of the brain-computer interface, continues to seek participants to further this research.

In addition to the CONVOY study, Neuralink has received FDA breakthrough device designation for its Blindsight implant, aimed at restoring vision in blind individuals. This implant works by activating neurons in the visual cortex to provide a visual image. Neuralink is also working on improving its surgical robot, R1, to automate the implantation process, which is crucial for scaling the technology to a larger population.

Overall, Neuralink's advancements represent a promising step towards integrating brain-computer interfaces into everyday life, potentially offering new levels of independence for individuals with severe disabilities. However, these technologies are still in the experimental phase, and widespread commercial availability is not yet on the horizon.

## China Launches Innovative Flying Robot to Explore Moon's South Pole for Water

China has launched an innovative mission, Chang'e-7, to explore the Moon's South Pole in search of water. This mission is notable for deploying a six-legged flying robot, which is a significant advancement over traditional rovers. The robot is capable of crawling, jumping, and flying using rocket propulsion, allowing it to access previously unreachable areas on the lunar surface, such as deep craters and rugged terrains.

The Chang'e-7 mission, set to launch next year, includes an orbiter, a lander, a lunar rover, and the flying robot. This mission aims to conduct the most detailed survey of the Moon's South Pole to date. The flying robot is expected to perform at least three powered leaps before switching to solar power for extended exploration.

This mission is part of China's broader strategy to establish a permanent research station on the Moon and to potentially land humans there by 2030. The South Pole of the Moon is of particular interest because it may contain ice deposits in permanently shadowed craters, which could be crucial for sustaining long-term human habitation. Through this mission, China aims to solidify its position as a key player in space exploration, alongside other nations like the United States.

## Caltech Engineers Develop Ink-Jet-Printable Skin Sensors for Health Monitoring

Caltech engineers have developed an innovative ink-jet-printable skin sensor technology that uses specially designed nanoparticles to monitor health biomarkers in real-time. These wearable biosensors can track various biomarkers, including vitamins, hormones, metabolites, and medications, by analyzing sweat or other bodily fluids. The core technology involves core-shell cubic nanoparticles, which are formed in a solution containing the target molecule, such as vitamin C. The nanoparticles are then processed to leave behind a polymer shell with holes that match the shape of the target molecule, functioning like artificial antibodies.

The core of these nanoparticles is made of nickel hexacyanoferrate, a material that can be oxidized or reduced when exposed to an electrical voltage in the presence of an electrolyte, such as sweat. This allows the sensors to generate an electrical signal that indicates the concentration of the target molecule. The sensors have been successfully used to monitor metabolites in long COVID patients and chemotherapy drug levels in cancer patients, demonstrating their potential for personalized healthcare and continuous, noninvasive monitoring of chronic conditions.

The technology enables the mass production of these sensors, which can be customized to monitor multiple biomarkers simultaneously. This advancement points towards a future where healthcare can be tailored to individual needs, improving treatment outcomes and enabling precise drug dosing.
