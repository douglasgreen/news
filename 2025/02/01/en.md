## Trump Revokes Legal Status of Immigrants from Biden's CHNV Program

The Trump administration is planning to revoke the legal status of over 530,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. These migrants were initially granted legal entry into the United States under a Biden-era program known as CHNV, which aimed to provide a regulated alternative to illegal immigration by allowing migrants to enter legally if they had American sponsors.

### Key Points

- **Revocation of Legal Status**: The Trump administration argues that the CHNV program misused immigration parole, which was not intended for large-scale use. As a result, they plan to revoke the parole status of these migrants.
- **Deportation Proceedings**: Migrants who lose their parole status and do not have other legal immigration benefits, such as asylum, a green card, or Temporary Protected Status, will face deportation proceedings. This means they will lose their ability to work legally in the U.S. and will receive notices to appear in immigration court.
- **Impact on Migrants**: The revocation of legal status will significantly impact the migrants' ability to remain in the U.S. legally. Those without additional immigration benefits will be at risk of deportation, affecting their livelihoods and stability.
- **Legal Options**: While the CHNV program was not a path to U.S. citizenship or permanent residence, some migrants might still adjust their status through other means, such as applying for asylum or Temporary Protected Status, depending on their circumstances and eligibility.

This move by the Trump administration marks a significant shift in immigration policy, reversing efforts made during the Biden administration to provide legal pathways for migrants from these countries. The decision is likely to have profound implications for the affected individuals and their communities.

## Medical Plane Crashes in Philadelphia

A small medical jet, a Learjet 55, crashed in a residential neighborhood in Northeast Philadelphia on Friday evening, causing significant destruction and multiple fires. The crash occurred shortly after the plane departed from Northeast Philadelphia Airport, bound for Springfield, Missouri. The aircraft was carrying six people: four crew members, a pediatric patient, and the patient's escort. The patient, a young girl from Mexico, had just completed treatment at Shriners Children's Philadelphia and was returning home.

The crash resulted in several homes catching fire and multiple injuries on the ground. Six people were hospitalized, with three remaining in fair condition. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) are investigating the incident, with the NTSB leading the investigation.

Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker and other officials have not confirmed the number of fatalities, urging residents to stay away from the crash site. The area around Roosevelt Boulevard and Cottman Avenue, where the crash occurred, is densely populated with rowhomes, and the impact was felt by many residents who reported their homes shaking.

Emergency responders, including firefighters and police, quickly arrived at the scene, and a shelter was set up by the Red Cross and the School District of Philadelphia for those displaced by the crash. The community has been urged to avoid the area as investigations continue.

## Data Removed Under Trump Administration

Since Donald Trump was inaugurated, there have been significant changes to government websites and datasets, particularly those related to environmental and public health data.

### Datasets Removed from Data.gov

- Nearly 3,000 datasets have disappeared from Data.gov since Trump's inauguration. The number of datasets decreased from 307,854 to 305,564 shortly after he took office.
- The removal of datasets is attributed to various factors, including routine changes during administration transitions, link rot, and intentional deletions. Some datasets were archived on agency-specific sites instead.
- Environmental science agencies like the Department of Energy, NOAA, and the EPA were disproportionately affected by these deletions.

### Government Websites and Data Affected

- Public health information was removed from several federal websites following Trump's executive orders targeting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives and transgender protections.
- The CDC's website saw the removal of contraception guidance, HIV and transgender-related fact sheets, and other resources.
- The State Department and other agencies were directed to remove gender-specific pronouns and references to "gender ideology" from websites and documents.
- The Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool and the Environmental Justice Scorecard were among the resources taken offline.

### Efforts to Preserve Data

- Archivists and researchers have been working to save and restore valuable datasets that have been removed. The Public Environmental Data Project is one such initiative, aiming to preserve data resources that are at risk of being taken offline.
- This effort includes archiving datasets and creating backups to ensure continued access to important environmental and public health information.

These actions reflect broader policy changes under Trump's administration, particularly concerning environmental and social justice issues. The removal of datasets and information from government websites has raised concerns about transparency and access to scientific data. `

## Trump Imposes Tariffs

On Saturday, President Donald Trump imposed new tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China. The tariffs include a 25% duty on imports from Canada and Mexico, and a 10% duty on imports from China. However, Canadian oil imports will be subject to a lower tariff of 10%.

The tariffs are part of Trump's strategy to address issues such as illegal immigration and the smuggling of chemicals used for fentanyl production. Additionally, Trump aims to boost domestic manufacturing and generate federal revenue through these tariffs.

The decision has sparked concerns about potential price increases for U.S. consumers, as the tariffs could affect a wide range of products, including gasoline, automobiles, and groceries. The move also raises the risk of a trade war with these countries, as they are among the U.S.'s largest trading partners.

In response, Canada and Mexico have indicated that they are prepared to implement retaliatory measures if necessary. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum have both expressed readiness to respond to the tariffs, emphasizing the potential negative impact on economic growth and inflation.

The tariffs could lead to significant economic consequences, including disruptions in supply chains and increased costs for U.S. manufacturers, which may ultimately be passed on to consumers. The situation also poses political risks for Trump, as it could contradict his promises to reduce inflation and improve economic conditions for middle-class families.
