## Trump Administration Orders Layoffs for Federal Workers on Probation

The Trump administration has initiated a significant reduction in the federal workforce by targeting probationary employees. These employees, who are generally new hires with less than a year of service, are being laid off as part of a broader effort to downsize the government. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which acts as the federal government's human resources department, has instructed various agencies to terminate these workers. This move is expected to impact hundreds of thousands of federal employees across different departments.

The layoffs have sparked protests and criticism from various quarters. Many argue that the decision to target probationary employees is politically motivated and not based on performance. Critics, including union leaders, have expressed concerns that this approach undermines the recruitment and development of new talent within the federal workforce. They argue that the administration is discarding skilled workers who are essential for the effective functioning of government agencies.

Despite the backlash, the administration is pressing forward with its plans. President Trump has signed an executive order directing agencies to prepare for large-scale reductions in force.

The administration's actions are part of a broader strategy to reduce government spending, although the actual savings from these layoffs remain uncertain.

## TikTok Returns to U.S. App Stores

After a brief absence, TikTok is back on Apple and Google's app stores in the United States. The popular social media app was removed due to a new law that banned it, citing national security concerns over its Chinese ownership. However, President Trump issued an executive order delaying the enforcement of this ban, allowing TikTok to return to the app stores.

The decision to bring TikTok back came after Apple and Google received assurances from the U.S. government that they would not face penalties for hosting the app. This assurance was crucial as both companies were initially hesitant to restore TikTok without clear legal protection. The law, signed by President Biden, required TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to sell the app to a non-Chinese owner to continue operating in the U.S..

Despite the temporary reprieve, the future of TikTok in the U.S. remains uncertain. The suspension of the ban is set to expire on April 5, and if a resolution is not reached by then, the app could face removal once again. ByteDance continues to protest the law, arguing that it securely stores user data and that the ban infringes on free speech rights. For now, U.S. users can enjoy TikTok and download any updates that were missed during its brief absence from the app stores.

## Resignations Shake U.S. Justice Department Over NYC Mayor's Corruption Case

In a dramatic turn of events, six top U.S. prosecutors have resigned after refusing to comply with a Justice Department order to drop corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams. The resignations include Danielle Sassoon, the acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, and two senior officials from the Justice Department in Washington. This decision has sparked a significant controversy, highlighting tensions between local prosecutors and federal authorities.

The case against Mayor Adams involves allegations of accepting illegal campaign contributions and bribes, including free or discounted travel, from individuals seeking to influence his decisions. Despite the serious nature of these charges, the Justice Department, under the leadership of Emil Bove, ordered the case to be dismissed. Bove argued that dropping the charges would allow Mayor Adams to focus on supporting President Trump's immigration policies and his re-election campaign. This move has been criticized by many as politically motivated and a departure from traditional legal practices.

Danielle Sassoon, in her resignation letter, expressed her confidence in the evidence against Mayor Adams and her dismay at the Justice Department's decision. She described the situation as a dangerous precedent, where political considerations overshadow the rule of law. The resignations have raised concerns about the independence of the Justice Department and its commitment to upholding justice without political interference.
