## Trump Signs Order to Stop Federal Funds for Schools with COVID-19 Vaccine Mandates

President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that stops federal funding for schools and universities that require COVID-19 vaccinations. This decision is part of his promise to protect personal freedoms and ensure that education is not tied to government mandates. The order affects K-12 schools and higher education institutions that mandate COVID-19 vaccines for in-person attendance.

The executive order directs the Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services to create guidelines to end what Trump calls "coercive" vaccine mandates. The order also requires these departments to report on schools that do not comply and to identify federal grants and contracts that could be affected. Although most schools have already dropped COVID-19 vaccine requirements, this order reinforces Trump's stance against such mandates.

Trump's decision has sparked debate. Supporters argue that it protects individual rights and parental choice, while critics worry about the potential impact on public health and education funding. Despite the controversy, Trump remains committed to his campaign promise to prevent schools from imposing COVID-19 vaccine mandates, emphasizing the importance of medical freedom for students and their families.

## Vance's Bold Speech in Munich: A Call for European Reflection

Vice President JD Vance delivered a controversial speech at the Munich Security Conference, where he criticized European leaders on various issues, including free speech, security, and mass migration. His remarks highlighted growing tensions between the United States and its European allies. Vance emphasized that the greatest threat to Europe was not external forces like Russia or China, but rather internal challenges, such as the retreat from fundamental values shared with the United States. His comments were met with mixed reactions, including scattered applause and some groans, especially when he made a joke comparing American democracy's resilience to Greta Thunberg's activism.

Vance's speech also touched on the political landscape in Europe, urging leaders to reconsider their stance on far-right parties like the Alternative for Germany (AfD). He argued that isolating these parties was not the solution and called for an end to what he described as "firewalls" against them. This stance shocked many attendees and was seen as an unusual intervention in the domestic politics of a democratic ally. Vance's remarks suggested a shift in the trans-Atlantic relationship, focusing more on expanding the MAGA movement's influence abroad rather than countering Russian aggression.

The speech came at a time when the Trump administration was facing criticism for its handling of peace efforts in Ukraine. European leaders expressed concerns over the exclusion of Kyiv and the continent from peace talks. Vance, along with other U.S. officials, met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss the ongoing conflict. Despite his previous opposition to U.S. assistance to Ukraine, Vance assured that the U.S. was committed to achieving a lasting peace. However, his speech in Munich seemed to prioritize internal European issues over the immediate threat posed by Russia's actions in Ukraine.

# Trump Establishes National Energy Dominance Council

President Donald Trump has taken a significant step to boost America's energy sector by creating the National Energy Dominance Council. This new council aims to increase domestic oil and gas production, which Trump describes as "liquid gold." By focusing on energy production, the council seeks to strengthen the U.S. economy and reduce energy costs for American families.

The council will be led by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, with Energy Secretary Chris Wright as vice-chair. It will work to streamline energy policies across the federal government, making it easier to produce and distribute oil, gas, and electricity. The council's efforts are expected to enhance America's energy independence and support global energy security by increasing exports to allies in Europe and beyond.

Trump's administration has also announced plans to lift restrictions on offshore drilling and revive a canceled pipeline project. These actions are part of a broader strategy to remove regulatory barriers and promote innovation in the energy sector. By prioritizing fossil fuels, the council aims to make the U.S. a leader in energy production and ensure reliable, affordable energy for the future.
