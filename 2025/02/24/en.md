### Agencies and Unions Urge Federal Workers to Ignore Musk's Email

In a surprising move, Elon Musk, serving as an adviser to President Donald Trump, sent an email to federal workers demanding they report their weekly accomplishments or face termination. This directive, part of Musk's efforts to streamline government operations, was met with resistance from several federal agencies and labor unions. The email, titled "What did you do last week?" was sent to hundreds of thousands of federal employees, giving them a 48-hour deadline to respond. However, many agencies, including the FBI and the State Department, advised their employees not to comply, citing concerns over the legality and appropriateness of the request.

The situation has sparked confusion and concern among federal workers, who are already facing uncertainty due to Musk's aggressive cost-cutting measures. The American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal workers' union, has threatened legal action, arguing that Musk lacks the authority to fire employees for not responding to the email. The union's president, Everett Kelley, criticized the directive as disrespectful and out of touch, emphasizing the critical services federal employees provide to the American public.

Despite the pushback, Musk defended his actions, describing the email as a "basic pulse check" to ensure government efficiency. He claimed that many federal employees were not performing their duties effectively, although he provided no evidence to support these allegations. The controversy highlights the tension between Musk's cost-cutting initiatives and the federal workforce's stability, as agencies and unions continue to challenge the legality and ethics of his approach.

### Germany's Election Surprise: Conservatives Win, Far-Right Gains Ground

In a surprising turn of events, Germany's conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), emerged victorious in the recent national elections, securing 28.6% of the vote. This victory marks a significant comeback for the conservatives, led by Friedrich Merz, who is set to become the new chancellor. However, the election also saw the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party making historic gains, becoming the second-largest party with 20.8% of the vote. This result has raised concerns about the growing influence of far-right ideologies in Germany's political landscape.

The election was held earlier than planned due to the collapse of the previous coalition government led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz. The campaign was dominated by issues such as economic stagnation and immigration, which resonated with many voters. The AfD's strong performance, particularly in eastern Germany, reflects a shift in voter sentiment towards more extreme positions. Despite their gains, the AfD faces challenges in forming alliances, as mainstream parties, including the CDU, have ruled out any coalition with them.

Friedrich Merz now faces the daunting task of forming a stable government. While he has ruled out partnering with the AfD, he may need to negotiate with other parties like the Social Democrats (SPD) or the Greens to secure a majority in the Bundestag. The election results highlight a divided nation, with traditional parties losing ground to both the far-right and far-left. As Germany navigates this new political landscape, the focus will be on how Merz and his government address the pressing issues facing the country while maintaining democratic values and unity.

### Tanks Roll into West Bank: A New Chapter in a Long Conflict

For the first time in over two decades, Israeli tanks have entered the occupied West Bank, marking a significant escalation in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine. The tanks moved into Jenin, a city known for its history of resistance against Israeli forces. This move comes as part of a broader Israeli military operation aimed at dismantling militant groups in the region. The Israeli government has stated that this action is necessary to prevent further attacks on Israeli civilians, following recent bombings in Tel Aviv that were linked to militants from the West Bank.

The situation has led to the displacement of approximately 40,000 Palestinians, who have been told they cannot return to their homes. This decision has drawn criticism from the international community, with many viewing it as a violation of human rights. The Israeli Defense Minister, Israel Katz, has emphasized that the military presence will remain as long as necessary to ensure security and stability in the region. Meanwhile, Palestinian leaders have condemned the operation, calling it an aggressive move that further entrenches Israeli control over Palestinian territories.

The deployment of tanks and the ongoing military operations have heightened tensions in the region, with fears of further violence and instability. The international community is closely monitoring the situation, urging both sides to seek peaceful resolutions and avoid actions that could lead to more bloodshed. As the conflict continues, the lives of many Palestinians remain in limbo, caught in the crossfire of a struggle that has persisted for decades.

### Former Surgeon Faces Trial for Alleged Abuse of Hundreds

In France, a former surgeon named Joël Le Scouarnec is facing trial for allegedly abusing 299 victims, most of whom were children. This trial is one of the largest child abuse cases in the country's history. Le Scouarnec, now 74, is accused of committing these acts over several decades while working in various hospitals.

### Amazon Stops USB Book Downloads for Kindle, Users Lose Flexibility

Amazon has decided to remove the "Download & Transfer via USB" feature for Kindle devices, which means users can no longer download ebooks from Amazon to their computers and then transfer them to their Kindle using a USB cable. This change is likely aimed at reducing ebook piracy, as it was possible to crack the DRM protection on downloaded ebooks and share them illegally. However, this decision also affects users who followed the rules, as they now have less flexibility in managing their ebook collections. Previously, users could save ebooks on their computers as backups or transfer them without needing a Wi-Fi connection. Now, they must rely on Wi-Fi to move ebooks to their Kindle, which can be inconvenient for those with unreliable internet access. This move also signals a shift away from the older AZW3 format to the newer KFX format, which is harder to crack. While users can still sideload ebooks via USB using third-party software like Calibre, the direct download option from Amazon's website is no longer available, leaving some Kindle owners frustrated with the reduced control over their purchased content.

### New 3D Microscope Maps Molecules Inside Cells

Scientists have developed a groundbreaking 3D microscope that can map all the molecules within a cell. This new tool combines two advanced technologies: polarized fluorescence, which measures how molecules are oriented, and a dual-view light sheet microscope, which captures images from different angles. This combination allows researchers to see the full 3D orientation and position of molecules, such as proteins, inside cells. This is important because proteins often change their orientation in response to their environment, which affects how they interact with other molecules. The new microscope can help scientists understand these changes better, potentially revealing hidden biological processes. The team behind this innovation hopes to make the system faster and develop new fluorescent probes to study a wider variety of biological structures [0][1].
